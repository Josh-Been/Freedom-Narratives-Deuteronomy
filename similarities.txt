## CONTEXT: 

Without vision the people perish.Man as important in prompting and stimulating him to do his best needs that enlarged vision and quickening inspiration that come from a well-trained, capacious and a well-stored mind with living, uplifting truths.
But morality or the moral life must be watched and molded with great care and fervent prayer, for the moral life is a round higher in the ladder of human development, human progress.Says one,    Morality is the vestibule of religion.       Morality is essential to good government.       What can laws do without morals?    Says Dr. Horace Mann,    Ten men have failed from defect in morals where one has failed from defect in intellect.    Without enlightening the conscience and strengthening the moral sense and moral obligation you can't become good brothers and sisters, good companions, good teachers, good neighbors, good husbands and wives, good fathers and mothers, good citizens.
This brings us to consider the spiritual life, the Christian religious life, which forms the climax of human development, advance and progress.While it is the duty of each both in the morning and evening of the day and of life to watch and guard and preserve and develop the health of the body, to cultivate, enlarge and enrich the mind and to enlighten and strengthen the moral sense, yet it is the spiritual life that brings us into the family of God, links us with all that is brightest and best in eternity.

 >> It is here man's first and highest duties lie.    

 >> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy might.       

 >> And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.       
Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,    and we have the promise that all necessary temporal blessings shall be added.
   Bodily exercise profiteth little, but Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.       Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth.   
   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.    It is by belief in Jesus as the Son of God that one is born unto the Kingdom of God and comes into possession of spiritual life and has communion and fellowship with the triune God and His loyal, faithful servants and is prepared to sow the good seed of which Jesus spoke that fell into good ground and brought forth some an hundred fold.

## CONTEXT: 

The storms and howling tempests have rained hailstones upon his quivering bark for three thousand years.Empires have arisen, kings have reigned, states have grown up, towered and fallen, hoary dynasties have been broken upon the wheel of time, great rivers have changed their beds and have cut their pathway through the hardest rocks, filling seas and gulfs with their drifting matter.In the wake of the ages and the march of time, the bodies of the millions have fallen, and their bleaching bones and    cities of the dead    tell the sad story of death.The tall cedars of Lebanon, and proud oaks of Bashan, have withered by the blight of age; still the Jew is the same.He has outlived the ages, outlived the ravages of war and persecutions.He has lived through flood and flame, through famines, pestilences, endemics and epidemics.Like the Gulf Stream, he flows on in his own channel without mixing with contacting elements, whether they be Japhetic or Hamitic.They are God's ancient people   the repository of the oracles of truth   and he will punish the world for the slain of his chosen Israel.In the economy of Providence he stands as a gigantic tower of strength to attest the truth and the Divine authority of Revelation.This is the standing memorial of Christianity and the miracle of the ages.
 >> Infidelity may rage and vent its keen shafts of spleen against the ramparts of God, but here is a truth whose impregnable parts stand the rage of the enemy and the assaults of hell.   

 >> Then, one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

 >> Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
This is the first and great commandment.And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.   
Let us observe then, three reasons why we should love God: (1) Because he commands us to love him. (2) Because we cannot be happy without loving him.(3)Because he first loved us.
We should love God (1)Because he commands us to love him.

## CONTEXT: 

What such service is; what it consists in.
In giving to Christ and His service our purest and deepest affection   love.
Where there is love, there is interest, keen, inspiring, lasting.Affliction becomes light and duties sweet.
The soul that feeds on love grows upon what it feeds, and such a soul is on the road to a frame of mind and state of being, where it can largely realize and appreciate the lofty sentiments of the ancient Hebrew rabbis expressed in the words:

   Joy is duty, so with golden lore,
The Hebrew rabbis taught in days of yore.
And happy human hearts heard in their speech
Almost the highest wisdom man can reach.   

Yet still rising far above is the voice of one whose name is love, teaching those whom His words employ.Life is divine when duty is a joy.Joy then is the fruit of love, that greatest thing in the world which scatters seeds of kindness and sends forth rays of sunshine along life's pathway.
2.Why a life of complete and full service to Christ should be given.

 >> (a) Because God commands it.   

 >> Hear, O Israel! the Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy might.       

 >> And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.       Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do with thy might.       
Life is the time to serve the Lord; the time to insure the great reward.   
   She hath done what she could.       This measures up to the exact requirement.       She built for herself and for the world a monument and obtained the approval and the praise of Jesus.       She built better than she knew.       Jesus said:    Verily I say unto you wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also, that this woman hathe done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.      
3.How a life of complete and full service to Christ is to be given.

## CONTEXT: 

Since man was created in the likeness of God and for His glory, there seems to have been some adversary, the Devil, who has been drawing him from the purpose of his creation, and since his first fall, through ages, and all nations, there has been a struggle, whether from fear of punishment or the hope of regaining Eden, a struggle in the human heart to lift itself to its ideal and to give reverence, obedience and worship to some power other and higher than itself.This struggle is called religion.The highest possible authority declared,    It is not good for man to be alone,    so we find men gathered together, either in hamlets or towns, villages or cities.This necessitates codes of law for government, just as the mighty wheels of Nature turn, propelling the world around upon its axis.We find men pondering over organic laws to govern men.Nature has given him its glories, its high mountains abounding in gold and silver, and many other useful minerals, its beautiful plains, covered with herds of cattle, its forests filled with beautiful birds, its oceans and lakes and rivers filled with fishes, and above these beauties He has fixed the sun, moon and stars, to light up His pathway.Man sees the world before him; must take upon himself the responsibility of its custodianship; he must see to it that all classes and kinds are governed under the organic system, and he must rule and keep each within its class.How to bring these two struggles into unity, how to make them a power, how to utilize them as a means of lifting humanity upward, how through them to cause man to perform the purpose of his creation.The glory of God is what we come to consider today.Had I the wisdom of Solomon or the oratorical power of Cicero, Mark Antony, Daniel Webster, Booker T. Washington, with it I would try to sway this nation to couple religion and society in every walk of life.
 >> Lacking these, I cannot do better than quote from our blessed Master, who was called on during His ministry here by the scribes, who asked the first commandment.

 >> He put it in these words, which comprise the wisdom and eloquence of the above mentioned dignitaries:    Love the Lord thy God with all of thy heart, and with all of thy soul, and with all of thy mind, and thy strength.&

 >> This is the first commandment.
And the second is like unto it, namely, this:    Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.    There is none other greater than these, or in other words, be careful of thy religion and thy society.We, as a race, have obeyed the first of these instructions to such an extent until it may be said of us that a larger per cent are professed Christians than any other race in the world.All over this broad country of ours we see great accomplishments by us, showing that the feeling that permeated the bosom of David, that man after God's own heart, is not a stranger to us, and that we, like him, are not contented to dwell in castles while the Lord's tabernacle abides in a tent.We see beautiful temples estimated to be worth millions of dollars that have been erected by this race, since their emancipation.Some of our greatest men have gone by way of the church.This is not only true of our race.Man cannot be truly great without being religious.

Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!    But, says the apostle,    All things are yours; whether Paul, or Apolos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours, and ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's.    That is, the church with its living ministry, its divine oracles of truth, or all the forces, elements, and agencies of organized and unified Christianity, with the physical and civil creations belong to you.They are all your servants and your friends to bring you to God, and perfect your manhood, advance your happiness and give you heaven in the end, while they give humanity glorious perpetuity and resplendent activity throughout the ages to come.
1.The unity of Christianity.
Nothing proves the divine originality of Christianity and the authenticity of its cardinal doctrines more than its unity and perfect harmony with itself and with the ends and aims that it has in view.All through the ages, and all through the nations and the world's greatest civilizations, religion has been the universal and most prominent factor in the tastes, feelings and aspirations of men.The political, national and social forms that have obtained in human progress and developments have circled around its standard of morals, and received their force and propulsion from the germ seeds and grains of truth that have been evolved or brought from the great mine of the world's great religions.Though often mixed with error and covered by the dust of ages, though its symbolisms and external faculties have been perverted, prostituted and made to reach unholy ends, yet these religions carry with them some grains of truth, and in their fundamentals, when properly interpreted, point to God as the great Author and Founder of their central truths and vital principles.
 >> They show a unification of nature, intent, and purpose that make up a consistency and harmony in their respective parts which declare themselves to be of the one God.    

 >> Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord,    and so it might be said,    Hear, all ye religions of the nations and ages, the Lord thy God is one God and one Father.    

 >> From him all truth must come, since he is    the only true God,    and the only One in the universe that can dictate to the will and conscience and moral and religious proclivities of men and angels, and whatever other intelligences may reside in his dominions.
All truth is from God, and must lead to God.Every thread and line and living cable that ramifies and thrills the living entities, though sometimes hidden and broken and covered with the d  bris and scoria of the wear and tear of the centuries, will take us back to God, the great Original, chaining all to the rock-ribbed mountains of the eternal shore.If there were ten thousand religions, and ten times ten thousand forms of worship, to be true and beneficial to mankind, they must all point to God and own him as the true and only proper and rightful object of prayer, praise and adoration.    All things are yours,    to lead you to God and plant you on the solid rock of truth and the eternal shore.
2.As there is a unity in Christianity, there must be a unity in the government of God.
As there is but one God, there can be but one universal government, founded upon principles of oneness, uniformity and justice.The eternal form of government is nothing compared to its principles, those fundamentals upon which the kingdom may rest.

He went in and saw his little daughter, whom he asked to lend him a teapot to make himself some tea.Her mother came and looked cross and savage at him, and asked what he wanted.He replied I want to make a little tea.She refused him, and liberty to lie upon the floor, and bid him be off, a black rascal.He went on, but God opened the heart of a good Samaritan, who would not allow him to make use of his own, but gave him of her tea, and gave him a bed to rest his unworthy body, which the other and his wife had not grace enough in their heart to do.
DEUT. 15: 1   14.    At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.And this is the manner of the release: every creditor that lendeth aught unto his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother, because it is called the Lord's release; Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again, but that which is thine with thy brother, thine hand shall release, save when there shall be no poor among you, for the Lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it: Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I commanded thee this day.For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee, and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother; But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth.
 >> Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, the seventh year, the year of release is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him naught; and he cry unto the Lord against thee, and it be sin unto thee.

 >> Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him; because that for this thing the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto, for the poor shall never cease out of the land: Therefore I command thee saying, thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land.

 >> And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee.
And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty; thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress; of that wherewith the Lord thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.   
Shall the United States, which cannot bear the bonds of a king, cradle the bondage which a king is abolishing?Shall a republic be less free than a monarchy?Shall we in the vigor and buoyancy of our manhood, be less energetic in righteousness than a kingdom in its age?   C. STEWART.

Shall every flap of England's flag
Proclaim that all around are free
From farthest Ind to each blue crag
That beetles o'er the Western Sea,
And shall we scoff at Europe's kings
When freedom's fire is dim with us
And round our country's altar clings
The damning shade of slavery's curse;
Go let us ask of Constantine,
To lose his grasp on Poland's throat,
And beg the lord of Mahmoud's line
To spare the struggling Suliote,
Will not the scorching answer come
From turbaned Turk and fiery Russ,
Go loose your fettered slaves at home
Then turn and ask the like of us.

We northern men have to pay taxes for so many head of cattle, and so many head of horses,   and if they own houses, they have to pay taxes for them; and if they own land they have to pay taxes for that.Now our white brethren at the south have to pay taxes for these, houses and lands, and their horses and cattle, so Aaron says.

I'm certainly bound for Canaan's land;
Even so   Salvation, O the bleeding Lamb.Selah.


And next comes the recompense of the great reward, if faithful until death, as follows:   Installed as a prince of Jerusalem, and a warrior that of a knight of the consecrated cross of Christ, the Prince of Glory, and that of eternal life.Amen, and amen.
Hence, judge ye by this ye little flock of heaven, if ye have not one who has in deed and in truth measured arms with all hell, and claims himself to be a Washington and a Garibaldi for his King, the only heir of all heaven, yea, life and liberty; though he be left to wander up and down with a shaved head, owing to said mighty shock, that satan left him as a sore scar in attest of the battle fought; yea, in being so severe that it actually shattered the nervous system of the brain, as thought by his physician, probably for ever in this world, as the writer is now rather advanced in years, say, in his 47th, as may be seen strictly set forth in the Midnight Cry, yea, truly so, so we pass from this to a complete triumph in a temporal point of view, and we have done with the proposed Narrative.
And now the writer having been duly crowned, as it were, with a wreath of twelve stars, in token of the battle thus fought and the victory won, as before named, he carrying the scars of honor accordingly on his person until this day, say the 25th of 12th month, A.D. 1860, since the Christian era had its origin, even so, namely, a shattered nervous system of the brain, going continually with a shaved head, with a white spot of hair, in attest of the severe neuralgia in the head, occasioned by said dreadful shock upon the brain, he being now left to wander up and down through all the land clad more or less with dead friends clothing, as in the case of that of Elisha being truly clad with his father Elijah's mantle, and with it did he truly whip out or cause to to separate the water of the river Jordan, and conquered all earth and hell besides, and so found his way up to the portals of the skies, upon which Job's character may be seen written out, it does truly seem in four large brilliant stars, entitled Job's Coffin; he claiming not where of his own upon which he may rest the sole of his foot, only as named in the Midnight Cry.Notwithstanding all this, yet is his hope in the holy word of God, namely, the 71st and 91st Psalms of King David, stronger than ever; yea, so much so, that he has truly come to the conclusion to patiently wait upon the Lord, even his God, all of his appointed days, until his change come, he believing without a shadow of doubt that all things in the end thereof shall have worked together for his good, even so may God in his promised mercy grant.Amen, and amen.
And now, he having truly drank to the very dregs of the hot cup of satan's vindictive wrath, and the most dreadful feelings having all as a mighty thunder storm passed over, he rested for the remainder of the night as though he was reposing upon one of the richest sofas all earth could afford him, whilst that of his heavenly visions and conversation in heaven or the spirit world, probably it would not be here right or lawful to name.So we pass in saying that, having arose in the morning, his loving host desired of course to know how he rested during the night; he gladly answered as to the latter part, but to the fore part he thought it prudent not to let the left hand know of that of the right in this case; for instance, had not Samson revealed to his darling Delilah wherein his great strength lay, he might have escaped his untimely death.
Hence, he having spent about the happiest first day here on earth with said kind family, on second day morning he gave the Episcopal priest a call in behalf of his mission, who did most cordially, yea, and liberally aid him in advising as follows: that all the free colored people of these United States should be shipped off to Africa, but did not name what should be done with the three or four million of slaves of the South.
 >> As it seemed that some of the clergy of the North, had not got tired out in supping of the molasses of Louisiana, and of eating of the product of the sweatened rice ponds of South Carolina, and other rich staples from that source.

 >> Hence, if the writer may be permitted to judge in this particular, was it not the design to clear the United States of all the free colored people, so that thousands of others might be imported from the shores of Africa to the Southern market, and so establish their belief that slavery on the part of that race is a peculiar Divine Institution, and so nail said traffic, with all of its inexpressible horrors, on to the cross of Christ, who truly said, that thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour as thyself, and afterward sealed it to his cross with his dying breath, and so bade his loving flock adieu, until he shall come again in his everlasting kingdom of grace, and those who have faitfully adhered to said commandments, and none other, shall be permitted to drink with him the cup of love anew.

 >> Even so, in his holy name may it be, in token of his dying love written upon the table of every true believers heart, and sealed with his blood upon the cross.
Even so, praise God, all ye his faithful children.Amen, and selah.
And now, having left said village for Boston, and having made some several calls in the towns or villages on the way, his success was beyond all expectation, from the fact, that by the time he had arrived at good old Cambridge, Mass., and there having called on his Honor, E. E., who did most readily and liberally sign in behalf of the support of the poor agent's Mission, which caused others to subscribe who saw his name and donation, say about $200.Judge ye by this, ye loving readers, how the writer must have felt in body and mind in consequence of so miraculous a change in favor of one poor mortal, say in this age of our world 5864, since the day in which the morning stars sang together, and the sons of God shouted for joy, as has been strictly written out in the Midnight Cry, &c. Hence, may the blessings of God await him throughout the remainder of his journey towards his long home, namely, by the grace of God a peaceful grave.And here, before we pass, in justice to his honor, of no liittle merit and due qualification, in the opinion of the writer, had he only been elected President, and a Vice President from Louisiana, as captain and mate upon the old ship, that must soon start, as it were, for a four years voyage.Say, and in this, would not old Bunker Hill, Mass., and Jackson's Monument, La. have shook hands together; hence, what could the body have done under heaven but adhere, in obedience to the head and foot, in this all momentous case before us; and that probably with no little lamentation ere long, as none but God, in the humble opinion of the writer, can possibly avert the impending storm, that does so blacken the heavens, and cover the earth with thick darkness; yea, so much so, that it is no little felt by every true and devoted lover of his country.And for which will the writer here pray the Lord, even his God, yea, and that of Elijah, that whereas, he has truly stirred up the great bald Eagle's nest, as it were, even from New Orleans to Boston, yea, and that to a true sense of their danger, without thy helping hand to deliver them; therefore, O thou God of all love and long forbearance, yea, and most generously waiting still to be gracious and merciful unto this thy people, as thou hast been in the days of thy servant George, as in the case where thou didst deliver thy people of old, even Israel, by the hand of thy servant Moses, and wilt thou here, of thine inexpressible, ever abounding love and compassion, spare this, thy favored fig tree yet another and another year, so that thy faithful servants throughout this our land may dig about its roots, and so lop off all the dead and unnecessary limbs, that doth so hurtfully encumber it, that it cannot bear that sweet and most delicious fruit of love and liberty to all men alike, without distinction as to nation, climate or color; and if it then bear said fruit to meet the end for which it was truly intended by thy divine Providence, that thou shouldest reserve it as an eagle's nest unto thy Christ, even our Lord and great salvation, well; but if not, then thy holy word for it.Even so, amen, selah.

## CONTEXT: 

I am going to try it again to day, the 26th of June.I visited the pastor of the Methodist Church, South, he invited me in his drawing-room with a great deal of courtesy, and offered me a seat, and after a pleasant conversation I handed him my book; he took it, perused it awhile, then bought it, and signed his name to my blank book, after which I bade him God-speed, and left him.
I next went down town, and was asked by a young man to call on his father and he would buy one; so he did, and signed his name, he being a lawyer.I went into several other law offices, and some of them gave me a little money, and so I got along very well to-day; bless the Lord for it.
This is the 28th day of the month of June, and I leave this place for Baltimore, Md. I have gotten along about as well as I could have expected at this place.I was to have preached at the Baptist Church last night, but it rained and prevented the people from turning out to hear me.So I was not afforded an opportunity to preach.I now bid farewell to the city of Norfolk, and may God bless her good people for the courtesy shown me, and for their contributions and for the purchasing of a few of my books.
I boarded the steamboat    Alabama,    which landed me at Baltimore in safety.I soon found my way to the home of the pastor, whose name is Rev. E. W. S. Peek.
 >> He was in bad health, and could not entertain me, but sent me to another house where I could be cared for.

 >> At present I am at this house penning these lines.

 >> During my trip on the steamer I was treated very kindly indeed.
By selling my books, and with the money given to me, I succeeded in realizing four dollars, or more.The passengers appeared to have a tender feeling for me.Perhaps this feeling was due to my age.
This is the 29th day of June, 1894, and I am now in the city of Baltimore.I went up this morning to see the Mayor, but he was too busy to see me, but invited me to call again.
This is Monday, the 2d day of July, 1894.I visited the African Methodist Episcopal Church yesterday morning to see if I could find any one there.To my surprise I found the members in the class room having a good time.

## CONTEXT: 

But there is infidelity among the slaves.Many of these poor creatures become secret infidels, doubting the sincerity of the white preacher, and receiving for truth only so much of his teachings as may seem consistent with their views of justice.They sometimes listen to a colonization agent, and go off and say:    There is no such place as Liberia.It is only a trap of the kidnapper to send us to the cotton-fields of Georgia.   
When we remember that they see the white man selling their children, their husbands, their wives, with as little feeling as a stock-grower exhibits when selling his cattle, and that they hear the preacher declare slavery to be consistent with the Word of God, how can we expect them to confide in our statements, or to fall in love with the principles of Christianity?They cannot read for themselves, and, substituting man's teachings for the word of God, they frequently lapse into infidelity.
They hear ministers denouncing them for stealing the white man's grain; but, as they never hear the white man denounced for holding them in bondage, pocketing their wages, or for selling their wives and children to the brutal traders of the far South, they naturally suspect the Gospel to be a cheat, and believe the preachers and the slaveholder to be in a conspiracy against them.In vain do we tell them the justice of the Father, of the precious promises in the Word of Life.Unbelief springs up; they doubt our sincerity, and say:    We poor slaves can't read, and how do we know what the Bible says!    Bitter experience has taught me some of these objections while laboring among them.

 >> Christianity will overthrow slavery in this country, or slavery will overthrow that pure New-Testament Christianity which commands supreme love to God and universal love to man, of whatever color or condition.

 >> Our Divine Redeemer said,    Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, soul, mind, and strength; and thy neighbor as thyself.    

 >> It is impossible to love a man as yourself, and yet hold him as a chattel.
Those professed ministers of Christ who teach that chattel slavery or American slavery is well pleasing in the sight of Christ, or, in other words, that it is not a sin, are doing more to sap the foundations of Christianity in this land than any other class of public teachers.They are    sowing to the wind, and will reap the whirlwind.    They make Christianity cut its own throat.The Christian Church cannot exist unless marriage between one man and one woman is regarded as a sacred compact.Christianity has ever ignored polygamy; but chattel slavery is polygamy in its worst form.
The divine command to    honor thy father and thy mother,    is rendered void by slavery, which annihilates the parental relation, making the child honor his master, though, in so doing, he may dishonor his parents, and set at naught the laws of God.Where Popery prevails, it makes secret infidels of the intellectual classes.Where chattel slavery prevails, it does the same.

## CONTEXT: 

This was the case with the man of God that disobeyed God by eating and drinking in the place where God had forbidden him.
This was also the case with the Jews, who were the chosen and elect people of God; for he hath declared because of their unbelief, they should not enter into his rest, although it was appointed for them from the foundation of the world; as the Scriptures saith,    Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us, of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief.Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.    Hebrews iv. 1   6, 11.
 >> By which it is evident, if we believe we shall enter in, and if we believe not we shall not enter into that rest which remaineth for the people of God.

 >> This was likewise the case with the Israelites, whom the Lord saved and brought safe out of the land of Egypt, but afterwards destroyed them that believed not; as the Scriptures saith,    I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

 >> And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those, things they corrupt themselves.    Jude 5   10.
Thus I spoke unto the ministers, and said,    May the Lord change your hearts, your minds, and your thoughts; and give you a better understanding of his blessed word.    Now they were contending with me three days, at the end of which time they were convinced by the word of God, and his Holy Spirit, that they were wrong and that I was right.They then gave me the right hand of fellowship, we joined in prayer with each other, shook hands, and parted in love and friendship.

## CONTEXT: 

It affected the spiritual, moral and indestructible nature of man to an extent that changed his relations to God, and the regular order of his divine administration.A new combination of elements, including the federation of great totalities, must be evoked, and brought upon the drama of government, and operated on those planes and lines in total and strict accordance with truth and righteousness.The great God could not do wrong, but he could have mercy and send it to earth in the person of his Son.Hence, Christ came not to destroy, but to restore; not to condemn, but to save; not to bring hell, but to bring heaven; not darkness, but light; not disease, but health; not death, but life; therefore, he came to    restore all things.    He came to recast and set up the fallen temple of a broken humanity, reassemble its scattered parts and thrill its entirety with the ancient Shekinah.Humanity is to be restored, but how?    Not by might, nor by power,    but by Jesus Christ   the living-vital Christ   who is to take charge of the forces of nature, the elements, agencies and all the powers, natures, combinations, federations, fraternities, leagues, societies, constitutions, and all the active potentialities and grand totalities that operate upon the expanding horizon of universal humanity.God said to his Son,    Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possessions.    Again,    Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.And a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
 >> And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.    

 >> All things shall hearken to his voice, dance at the touches of his fingers, and vibrate at the majesty of his power.

 >> Every element, quantity, faculty and quality in the intricate mechanism of the universal order will be manipulated, wrought into beauty and harmony and made to assume its ancient relations by the coercive hand of the Eternal.   
The restitution of all things    includes the suspension of war, the nullification of corrupting institutions, and the overthrow of the massive conclaves of sin and infidelity that have poisoned the nations, slain their millions and left their writhing bodies, broken bones and bleeding carcasses in their track of death.It means the close of the saloon, the overthrow of drunkenness, the destruction of the opium traffic, the fall of slavery in every form, the purification of human society, the breaking of the prisoner's chains, and the freedom of the long-bound captive.It means the destruction and the total overthrow of all the forms, codes, teachings and ungodly practices of heathen priests and their superstitious systems of ill-founded theories and false religions.It means the fall of empires, the dissolution of kingdoms, the disintegration of states, and the perishing of municipalities, and the obliteration of every opposing foe and antagonizing power.Who can stand before the power of the Eternal, stay his hand and stop his kingdom?Look up, ye sons and daughters of God, get ready for the coming of the bridegroom.Fill your vessels with the oil of his truth,    trim the golden flame,    buckle on your sandals, girt your habit and march out to the music of his voice, and the choruses of his love.Look up, he is coming!

I knew them well; they were acquaintances of my master's.

 >> I was about to give up, and wished I had never started.
However, I climbed up a tree, and in the providence of God, the hounds scared up a rabbit.At the howling of the dogs, I trembled like a leaf, and knew not what to do.The hounds drew nearer and nearer; the rabbit came under the tree where I was, and, through the will of an overruling Providence, they all passed by, and I was safely delivered out of their hands.It was about eight o'clock in the morning when I climbed the tree.I was hungry and wet with dew.I staid in the tree till about five o'clock in the afternoon.They hunted the woods pretty well, but they did not find me.My words are inadequate to express my joyful feelings at my deliverance.

Mr. Sturges, was a very kind master, but exceedingly severe when angry.He had a new negro, by the name of Cato, with whom I got a fighting, and bit off his nose, just as my master was going to sell him, which injured the sale of Cato, very much.For this I had to beg very hard to escape being whipped.I went to the fortune tellers, who told me that my master said, that if he should take me on with him to New York, I should be free: so I knew that I should not go with him.I had always been in the habit of praying, ever since I knew what it meant; and whenever I went to church, to drive the carriage, I used to stand upon the steps, and listen to the preaching.About this time, I began to realize that I was a sinner, and that hell would be my portion if I should die in my present situation: and afterwards while I was living with Doct.Collock, and under the advice of the Rev. Mr. Collock, whose voice and preaching, harrowed up my soul with awful apprehensions, I sought and obtained the hope of salvation.Blessed be God, I know the path to heaven.I have had sweet communion with the Lord; but alas!I have erred, and gone astray from holiness.

 >> My conscience used sometimes to upbraid me with having done wrong, after I had run away from my master and arrived in Connecticut; and while I was living in Southington, Conn. (where I spent some time, as will afterwards be told) I went up on a high mountain, and prayed to the Lord, to teach me my duty, that I might know whether or not I ought to go back to my master.

 >> Before I came down I felt satisfied, and it did seem to me that the Lord heard my prayers, when I was a poor wretched slave, and delivered me out of the land of Egypt, and out of the house of bondage; and that it was his hand, and not my own artfulness and cunning, which had enabled me to escape: therefore if we trust in God, we need have no fear of the greatest trials; and though my heart has been pierced with sufferings keen as death, and drank from the cup of slavery, the bitterest dregs ever mingled in it; yet under the consolations of religion, my fortitude never left me.

 >> As Mr. Sturges was intending to remove to New-York, he sold out all his property, and every thing he could wish to part with.
He talked very strong of taking me on with him to New-York, but after consideration altered his mind, and hired me out to a Mr. Wolhopter, a printer in Savannah.I lived with Mr. Wolhopter all that summer, and drove his horses and carriages all about there, and out to White Bluff, where he had hired a seat for the summer, supposing it to be a healthy situation, which indeed it was; but we were tormented with moschetos and such other insects as infest that country (called by different names) to a great degree, so that we could hardly sleep nights.We were alternately at this place and at Savannah for the space of four or five months.At the expiration of that time, Mr. Wolhopter removed back to Savannah, with his family, and I accompanied them.I will here mention that during the time I resided at White Bluff, at the request of Mr. Wolhopter, I often went a fishing, and the rays of the sun beating down more severe there, than where I had formerly lived, it created an ague and fever, which reduced me so low that even my attending physician, Doct.Collock (who attended me strictly for about four months) dispaired of my life, and often since that time being borne down under the afflictions that a slave often experiences, and indeed too often, I have wished his predictions had proved true.But after Doct.Collock perceived I was convalescent, and gaining my health and strength rapidly, he enquired of me, that provided he should buy me, if I would be contented to live with him; drive his horses and carriage, occasionally wait in the house and at the table, and do such other business as is necessarily required in a family.

I was now under my sixth master, Mr. Sturges, who bought me from the Jew.Mr. Sturges was a very kind master, but exceedingly severe when angry.He had a new negro, by the name of Cato, with whom I got a fighting, and bit off his nose, just as my master was going to sell him, which injured the sale of Cato very much.For this I had to beg very hard to escape being whipped.I went to the fortune tellers, who told me that my master said that if he should take me on with him to New York, I should be free; so I knew that I should not go with him.I had always been in the habit of praying, ever since I knew what it meant; and whenever I went to church, to drive the carriage, I used to stand upon the steps and listen to the preaching.About this time I began to realize that I was a sinner, and that hell would be my portion if I should die in my present situation; and afterwards while I was living with Dr. Collock, and under the advice of the Rev.

With but few remarks I endeavor to give my readers but a faint representation of the hard treatment, ill-usage and horrid abuse the poor slave experiences while groaning under the yoke of bondage:   that yoke which is not easy, nor the burden light; but being placed in that situation, to repine is useless; we must submit to our fate, and bear up, as well as we can, under the cruel treatment of our despotic tyrants.

Yea, he did, for He is the maker of us all; and there is nothing made, but what was made by the immediate hand of God; and as he is able to make alive, is he not also able to kill?Yes, my dear reader, consider but for a moment, that if the Lord was able to kill three-and-twenty thousand in one day, he will not be one moment in taking thy life.For, in the twinkling of an eye, the breath which we now breathe, is taken from us; and, if we are not baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire, we cannot enter the kingdom of God.
Perhaps some of you may be enquiring what you should do; I would answer you in the words of our Saviour, where it is said,    And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise.Then came also publicans to be baptized. and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.    Luke iii.
 >> 10   14.

 >> It pleased God to send the Spirit of his Son into my heart, to bear witness with my spirit that I was a child of God, and that he had chosen me out of the world; therefore the world hated me, because I was not of the world; but they who were of God loved me, because that God had loved them first, and had shed abroad in their hearts the love of his Son, that they should love one another, even as God hath given us commandment.

 >> Thus did the people of Liverpool, for they showed me great kindness beyond measure, by God's assisting of them by his blessed Spirit: he that had two coats gave me one, and he that had meat did the same; and God crowned my feeble endeavours with great success, and gave me many seals to my ministry, and souls for my hire.
On taking my farewell of the people at Liverpool, after I had been there about five months, preaching the everlasting gospel, and ministering the ordinances of our blessed Lord and Saviour, which was the third time I had been to Liverpool, I said unto them,    Now, my dear and beloved friends in Christ, I am about to leave you in body, but I hope not in spirit; for I trust we shall see each other (who are followers of Christ) and that we shall meet in heaven around his throne: where parting shall be no more, where all trials and troubles shall have an end, where sorrow and sighing shall flee away, where the tears shall be for ever wiped from our eyes, where our wearied souls shall be at rest, where the wicked shall cease troubling us, and where our souls shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, and join with all the host of heaven, in singing the song of Moses and the Lamb, hallelujahs, and praises unto God for ever and ever.   
I then embarked at Liverpool for Newberry Port, in North America, and, thank God, we arrived in safety.I did not tarry at Newberry Port because I had some business to transact at Boston; where I arrived in safety, and settled my affairs, by God's assistance.I also met with many brothers and sisters in Christ, who were glad for my arrival.I stayed at Boston about three months, preaching the gospel of our blessed Jesus, and him crucified; and blessed and praised be God, my labours were not in vain, for many were alarmed and awaked out of their sleep of carnal security, turned from the evil of their ways, and walked in Christ the good old way to eternal joy, many souls were edified, and God glorified.
It appeared that God had greater work for me to do, and to go through many trials and tribulations, for it is through them that we are to enter the kingdom of God.After I had been at Boston three months and a half, I was constrained by the Spirit of God, to take a journey into a foreign country; so I took my leave from the people at Boston, who were sorry to part with me, so we parted with each other in body, but not in mind; and sung the following hymn:


We part in body, not in mind;
Our minds continue one;
And each to each in Jesus join'd,
We hand in hand go on

But his name is to be remembered in all generations, in the sense of including all the nations of the earth.His name is to be as widespread as the human race itself.The millions of earth's inhabitants are to join in the universal jubilee and know the universal salvation.The wheels of commerce are to roll it along their iron highways.The steel-clad    grayhounds    of the seas, dancing on the foam-crested paths of interoceanic traffic, must bear his name to millions who have not yet learned all the verses of the mighty chorus.Cables that sleep on the pebbly bottom of the deep must hum the syllables of his name to China, Japan, Africa, Australasia, to the    Latin States    and the great islands of the seas.Telegraphy and Telepathy are his winged messengers that stand ready to do his biddings.These fly and dart at his command and quiver with the celebration of his name.Shall the praises of his name stop here?
 >> Nay, my friends, in heaven it shall be continued, while the millenniums shall roll on their eternal cycles.

Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things.      Acts 3:19-21.
The text is designed to cover all those periods and dispensations of time through which and over which the Gospel kingdom should extend, and to cover those ages and arenas that compose its fields and areas of activity.In its organized capacity and character, the heavenly kingdom has its external and visible coalition of forces and its confederation of progressive and active entities and elements, as any other kingdom.Consecrated manhood with its wisdom, experience and achievements, makes up a great part of those factors that must always be an essential part of the visible body of the church of Christ.In one sense the church is a kingdom of men, since men must constitute its subject and present that plan of operation in which the splendid rule and power of the living Christ is manifest.But this part of the heavenly kingdom in which man is the active subject is but a part of the invisible and far-extended empire that covers the deep steps of the Infinite and that lives and acts upon the broader planes and the boundless spheres of being.On earth we only see and comprehend a diminutive phase of the power and majesty of that glory that lies in the beyond.

Brother Head strum, that wonderful man of God, Brother Moorehouse, and a number of others, were there.How well I remember dear John Cookman; he was then a power.I have no objection to his going to Heaven when his work was done, but somehow I felt as though he might have gone as safely through the dear old Methodist Church, that his father and brother Alfred, of blessed memory, loved and served so long; but praise the Lord, anyhow there are no sects in Heaven.Hallelujah!Oh, the City will be full of blood-washed souls out of every kindred, tongue and people.    What a gathering of the people that will be.   
Then there was Brother Tom Sherwood, and Brother Knox, and King.

   Cum on boy,    said Uncle Joe, not unkindly, yet in a tone that indicated there was to be no hanging back.Under these circumstances Mingo must be excused for not having lingered to say    Good night.    In fact,    his heart was too full for utterance.    And so the line of march was taken up in silence, Uncle Joe leading with his lantern, Mingo next, Mr. Ward bringing up the rear.When the humiliating performance was over, the party broke up.Mr. Ward returned to the house whistling softly:       From Greenland's icy mountains.    Uncle Joe, wending his way back to his cabin, sang in a low voice,    There's rest for the weary.   
Poor Mingo neither sang nor whistled.As he painfully took the shortest cut for the main road he consoled himself with the thought that      Faint heart never won fair lady.

CHAPTER V
THE HUNTING SEASON AT PINE TOP
   The Old Flag never touched the ground.    The Color Sergeant At Ballery Wagener
GAY hunting parties composed of friends from the city and ladies and gentlemen from the surrounding plantations often assembled at Pine Top.Many amusing tales were told there of the    Stag Fright    and blunders of amateur sportsmen on their first deer hunt.There was a Mr. Brabham, a carpenter, who being placed at a    stand    for the first time, and told not to let the deer pass him, waited in breathless anxiety.Soon a magnificent buck came bounding towards him almost within arms' reach.Throwing up his arms wildly, his gun held aloft, he exclaimed,    I wish I had my hatchet!    while the terrified animal sped on to be brought down by a more collected hunter on the next stand.

## CONTEXT: 

But it is certain that the nations of mankind have a subtle, schemeful and powerful foe to deal with   a foe whose gigantic arm of power sweeps the seas, grasps the islands with an iron grip; and wraps the belted zones of human civilization in the meshes of its nimble fingers, and with cords of steel and bands of iron ties them on to the papal car.Papal diplomacy is the most skilled and artful, and full of that cunning and manipulation that plays on human nature and pours itself into its superstitions, thrilling its religious faculties with the grandeur, augustness and bright paraphernalia of its orders and the tinsilized symbolisms of its public worship and service.Romanism claims all the churchism and prelatical authority that is worth claiming.There is nothing true, heavenly and divine, but that that is from the Roman See, or emanates from the pope and his great conclaves.His bulls, encyclicals and edicts, as excathredra, are the essence of unerring mandates and infallibility, and    the high arcanna    of    the Most High    is profanely assumed by the Bishop of Rome.
No man of common judgment, with any degree of acquaintance with the history of the Roman church, doubts the sagacity, the wisdom, the farsightedness of its popes, premiers, statesmen, cardinals, bishops and leaders.They have astonished the world with feats of diplomacy and an eternal series of brilliant intrigues that seem at times to be almost superhuman.Its 150,000,000 of devoted followers embraces all nations, and the sun never sets upon this politico-religious empire of the Roman pontiff.He is the highest ruler and the greatest king on earth,, and the only one that wears the triple crown and dictates to the hearts and consciences of men.
But the most fearful thing connected with this gigantic power is its claims to universal power and authority, both in church and state.
 >> This is not only a spiritual, but political kingdom as well.

 >> The Pope claims all the kingdoms of the world, and looks forward to the day when he alone shall hold all crowns in his hand, and wield the golden scepter of universal sway, and dictate to all the governments of the world.

 >> The church of Rome wants nothing less than supreme political power.
It will be contented with nothing short of it, and wherever and in whatever part of the habitable earth it shall gain this power, it will persecute and seek to accomplish by physical force what it cannot do by moral suasion.Where it has the control, it will not hesitate to resort to cruel tortures upon the wheel and the rack, and by fire and sword, put to death thousands and even millions who may dissent from its teachings and usages.This accords with its history and practice through its steady march of it thousand years, and there are no signs or probability of a change of doctrine, nature or practice.It is true, at present, its endeavors to put on a decent appearance and hold its political aspirations in abeyance, and politely bows to    the powers that be,    but it is the same old bloody Monarch and gay beast that has scattered the bones of innocent men and women through its long reign of tyranny, persecution and death.Its    Spanish Inquisitions,    its great court of death, has written its history in blood and reddened the soil with human gore.Nowhere in the annals of human history has there been presented to men, devils, or angels, greater cruelties and a more shocking, diabolical regime than those of the hellish and damnable Court of the Inquisition.
The enormity of vileness, the plenitude of the outflow of blood and tears, the multitudes of the slain and the valleys of bleaching bones, the dark, damp pits and rock-bound dungeons, the weeping widows and sighing orphans, and the burning highway and smoking track of this so-called church of God, is enough to put a tingy blush upon the cheeks of the world's civilizations and make mankind forever hate and execrate this blood-thirsty Moloch of the centuries.All this, too, is done in the name of the religion of love, and in the name of and for that meek and lowly Son of Mary that died on the cross to save the world of sinners.

## CONTEXT: 

There has always been so much to be done and we enjoy doing the Master's will, and we are both longing for a closer walk with God.We never have seen the place where we could go out just to have a good time or have been inclined to go over a city sight-seeing, while a battle has been on for souls.In fact we have gone to many places to work and, when we left could not tell what the town looked like any further than what was seen on the way to the train, or passed when in our car.While we were in the east some of our friends wanted to give us a good time, but there were so many who were unsaved, especially our own kindred, that we couldn't find time to go, as our time there was so short.While a revival is on we feel it is necessary to abstain from any visiting unless it is visiting or praying with the sick, or some one who needs help.Some have thought us strange and criticized us, but we never have time to stop and explain as we have to keep pace with the Spirit, as He leads us on.We love to take outings, and have taken a few just to rest our nerves and minds and to get quiet before the Lord.However, there have been very few times when we have not been given something to do while resting.We don't need to look for it as we have a ready mind, and this is what the Lord has given us through the baptism of the Holy Ghost.This has satisfied and settled us, and we have gladly turned away from worldly pleasures and let Him use us as He will.

 >> Through the study of the Word of God and with the experience of my own heart I have become thoroughly convinced that the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire, which purifies the heart by faith and causes it to overflow with the love of God to our fellow man, is the only thing that will give boldness in the day of judgment, and make us to be as He is in this world.

 >> God is love and He has set forth the command that we should love Him with all our heart, soul, and mind; also that we should love our neighbors as ourselves.

 >> On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
This is just what the world, with its infidelity, modernism, sin, and crime on every hand, is gasping for with its last breath.The love of many has waxed cold and there are those who have lost their first love.I pray the Lord to give to His people the love that never faileth.Many a heart is failing today over the things that are coming upon this earth.God is love; love never faileth.If we watch, pray, keep humble before Him, and ever trust in the shed blood of His Son, He can not, nor will He, deny Himself.We will have boldness because our sins have gone on before us to the judgment by the way of Calvary, and we can gladly meet the one who gave His life for us, just because He loved us, and loved first.Oh, glory, hallelujah!

## CONTEXT: 

Now for mischief! I began to address my companions on the subject of education and the advantages of intelligence over ignorance, and, as far as I dared, I tried to show the agency of ignorance in keeping men in slavery.Webster's spelling-book and the Columbian Orator were looked into again.As summer came on and the long Sabbath days stretched themselves over our idleness, I became uneasy and wanted a Sabbath-school in which to exercise my gifts and to impart to my brother-slaves the little knowledge I possessed.A house was hardly necessary in the summer time; I could hold my school under the shade of an old oak tree as well as any where else.The thing was to get the scholars, and to have them thoroughly imbued with the idea to learn.Two such boys were quickly found in Henry and John, and from them the contagion spread.I was not long in bringing around me twenty or thirty young men, who enrolled themselves gladly in my Sabbath-school, and were willing to meet me regularly under the trees or elsewhere, for the purpose of learning to read.It was surprising with what ease they provided themselves with spelling-books.These were mostly the cast-off books of their young masters or mistresses.I taught at first on our own farm.
 >> All were impressed with the necessity of keeping the matter as private as possible, for the fate of the St. Michaels attempt was still fresh in the minds of all.

 >> Our pious masters at St. Michaels must not know that a few of their dusky brothers were learning to read the Word of God, lest they should come down upon us with the lash and chain.

 >> We might have met to drink whisky, to wrestle, fight, and to do other unseemly things, with no fear of interruption from the saints or the sinners of St. Michaels.
But to meet for the purpose of improving the mind and heart, by learning to read the sacred scriptures, was a nuisance to be instantly stopped.The slave holders there, like slaveholders elsewhere, preferred to see the slaves engaged in degrading sports, rather than acting like moral and accountable beings.Had any one, at that time, asked a religious white man in St. Michaels, the names of three men in that town whose lives were most after the pattern of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, the reply would have been: Garrison West, class-leader, Wright Fairbanks and Thomas Auld, both also class-leaders; and yet these men, armed with mob-like missiles, ferociously rushed in upon my Sabbath-school and forbade our meeting again on pain of having our backs subjected to the bloody lash.This same Garrison West was my class-leader, and I had thought him a Christian until he took part in breaking up my school.He led me no more after that.
The plea for this outrage was then, as it is always, the tyrant's plea of necessity.If the slaves learned to read they would learn something more and something worse.The peace of slavery would be disturbed.

## CONTEXT: 

Miss Lucretia    had told him she would give him a pair of trousers if he could get himself clean.He had no home to regret, and he hardly dared to go to sleep, for fear he might be left behind.
Early on a Saturday morning he was able to look for the last time, as he hoped, on the plantation, as the sloop carried him over Chesapeake Bay towards Baltimore.He arrived there on Sunday morning, and was kindly received by his new Mistress, Mrs. Hugh Auld, sister-in-law of Lucretia's husband, Thomas.    Miss Sopha,    as the boy called her, gave him a comfortable bed, good clothes, and palatable food, while he had nothing harder to do than to run errands and take care of her son, little Tommy.All three soon grew very fond of each other, and she even granted a request, made under circumstances described thus, in a speech made at Belfast, in 1846:
   I remember the first time I ever heard the Bible read, and from that time I trace my first desire to learn to read.I was over seven years old; my master had gone out one Sunday night, the children had gone to bed.I had crawled under the center table and had fallen asleep, when my mistress commenced to read the Bible aloud, so loud that she waked me.She waked me to sleep no more.I have found since that the chapter she then read was the first of Job.
 >> I remember my sympathy for the good old man, and my anxiety to learn more about him led me to ask my mistress to teach me to read.   

 >> She complied gladly, and was soon looking forward to see him reading the Bible.

 >> Her joy led her to tell her husband, but he at once forbade any more lessons, telling her that learning would spoil any nigger, and that if this one should ever be taught to read the Bible, there would be no keeping him a slave.
This was said in Fred's hearing, and it proved the best lesson he ever had.He heard that knowledge would prevent his remaining a slave, and at once he made up his mind to get all he could.    Miss Sopha    not only taught him no more, but would snatch away any book or newspaper she might see in his hand, while she took great care never to leave him alone with anything he could read.He turned the street into a school-room, and made his white playmates his teachers.He always carried Webster's spelling-book in his pocket, and also bread enough to pay the hungry little boys he met for giving him lessons.He used now and then to ask these white boys if it was right for him to be a slave, and they always agreed with him that it was not.Finding them interested in the    Columbian Orator,    he bought a copy with fifty cents, earned by blacking boots in the street.Here he found a dialogue between a runaway slave, just recaptured, and his master.

As I went into the door he was at home.I felt so new and so light; it was a new world, for I was born again, this time from above.I said to him,    I have been to church today and am saved.

   Thou must accept liberty, James; it is a great while since it was due to thee.Would to God, the Father of all men, that the whites had never thought of trading in thy African brethren; may He inspire all men with the desire of following our example.We, who regard liberty as the first of blessings, why should we refuse it to those who live among us?   
   Ah, my master!you are so good is the reason I wish not to leave you   I have never been a slave.You have never spoken to me but as you speak to white men; I have lacked nothing, either in sickness or in health; I have never worked more than your neighbors, who have worked for themselves.
   I have been richer than many whites   to some of whom I have lent money.

No master!it is seed time   I will take my pleasure another time   one day only shall be a holiday in my family.Then, since you will have it so, I will accept my liberty; and my first action, as a free man, is to take your hand, my master, press it between mine, and lay it on my heart, where the attachment and gratitude of James will not cease until that ceases to beat; and until that moment be assured that no laborer in the county of Kent will be more industrious than he who henceforth shall be called FAITHFUL JAMES.   
EZEKIEL COSTON,
AGED upwards of eighty-three years, related to Samuel Canby, of Wilmington, Delaware, in 1825, the following circumstances of his freedom from his master, the late Warner Mifflin, a Quaker: and it may be observed, that he always supported an unblemished character:
That he was born a slave in the family of Daniel Mifflin, of Accomack county, Virginia, with whom he lived until about twenty years of age; about which period Warner Mifflin (son of Daniel) married a daughter of John Kensey's, of West River, Maryland, and settled near Camden, in the State of Delaware.Ezekiel, and five other slaves, were given him by his father; there were also a number of slaves belonging to his wife brought into the family.
He lived with Warner Mifflin about eighteen months, when he put him on a plantation of his to work it, about six miles from his residence, where he continued about four years a slave.At this period Ezekiel was informed by his master that he had concluded to set his slaves free; and very soon after his master came to his residence, and calling him from the field where he was ploughing, they sat down together, when he told Ezekiel his mind had long been uneasy with holding slaves, and that he must let him go.
Ezekiel was so well satisfied with his present situation, that he told his master he could not leave him.

CHAPTER II.
CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE FROM THE TIME OF HIS LEAVING AFRICA TO THAT OF HIS BECOMING FREE.
AFTER all the business was ended on the coast of Africa, the ship sailed from thence to Barbadoes.After an ordinary passage, except great mortality by the small pox, which broke out on board, we arrived at the island of Barbadoes; but when we reached it, there were found, out of the two hundred and sixty that sailed from Africa, not more than two hundred alive.These were all sold, except myself and three more, to the planters there.
The vessel then sailed for Rhode Island, and arrived there after a comfortable passage.Here my master sent me to live with one of his sisters until he could carry me to Fisher's Island, the place of his residence.I had then completed my eighth year.After staying with his sister some time, I was taken to my master's place to live.
When we arrived at Narraganset, my master went ashore in order to return a part of the way by land, and gave me the charge of the keys of his trunks on board of the vessel, and charged me not to deliver them up to anybody, not even to his father, without his orders.
 >> To his directions I promised faithfully to conform.

 >> When I arrived with my master's articles at his house, my master's father asked me for his son's keys, as he wanted to see what his trunks contained.

 >> I told him that my master intrusted me with the care of them until he should return, and that I had given him my word to be faithful to the trust, and could not, therefore, give him, or any other man, the keys without my master's directions.
He insisted that I should deliver to him the keys on pain of punishment.But I let him know that he should not have them, let him say what he would.He then laid aside trying to get them.But notwithstanding he appeared to give up trying to obtain them from me, yet I mistrusted that he would take some time when I was off my guard, either in the daytime or at night, to get them, therefore, I slung them round my neck, and in the daytime concealed them in my bosom, and at night I always slept with them under me, that no person might take them from me without my being apprized of it.Thus I kept the keys from everybody until my master came home.When he returned he asked where VENTURE was.As I was within hearing, I came and said,    Here, sir, at your service.    He asked for his keys, and I immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him.

 >> The place may be a house with steel gates and adamantine floors, with rock-ribbed mountains of impassable heights, from whose fiery summits sentinels of towering blasts forever play upon angry floods and burning seas   a place where every man is against every other man, and where envy, anger, hatred, malice, lust and pride fill every heart, and falsehood and slander ride supreme on every tongue   a place of perpetual strife and endless war, endless in duration and endless in the depth of its vileness and infamy   a place where spirits bold and daring meet in dreadful conflict and battle array with clashing sabres playing upon the bosom of the deep in the plenitude of power and the darkness of the night.

 >> But hear it, prison house of the lost, with your gates of steel and adamantine floors, where no suns burn, nor stars twinkle, where no comets flash nor meteors blaze, no    pale empress of the night    smile on a darkened world, where no orb of fire has sent a rippling rill of flame across thy dark mountains, nor plowed those abysmal depths of interminable night.

 >> Hear it, ye spirits bold and daring, with your clashing sabres playing upon the bosom of the deep in the plenitude of power and in the darkness of hell.
Man is immortal, and has endless development and endless progression, whether he is in heaven or in hell.Man, then, is a gem.He belongs to those bright stars in the galaxy of God whose unfading lustre and brilliant corruscation will shine on through endless days.Christ came all the way from heaven to seek and save him.He is lost.His place is vacant in the twinkling galaxy of heaven.His value is measured by the price paid, and that price is the blood and tears and the death of the Son of God.
But death is a conqueror.

Mr. Fairport was a native of Lynn, Massachusetts, and some ten years before had introduced himself at the South as a pedler of wooden clocks and sundry articles of tinware.In that business he was very successful, and in a few years had cleared to himself some four or five thousand dollars in ready cash, with which he commenced operating by purchasing notes and small bonds and mortgages, and by accommodating the young Southern gentlemen with loans in the winter season, to be repaid after the next tobacco harvest, with from 25 to 50 per cent.interest.In this way, by the aid of Mr. Grip, a lawyer in Raleigh, he increased the amount of his funds with astonishing rapidity.During the war with Great Britain the difference in exchange between the South and North became very considerable, and before its close rose to 20 per cent.; and Mr. Fairport having established a credit at Boston, and a pretty good understanding with the managers of the general post-office at Washington, his gains were enormous.
Mr. Fairport was a little under the usual size, miserably emaciated, with a long chin, sharp pointed nose, small gray eyes, sunk very deep into his head, a cadaverous complexion, and a most grave and melancholy countenance.He was a religious man, and a member of the Presbyterian church of his native town, and held strictly to the Saybrook Platform.
Mr. St. John had for some time been in the practice of borrowing small sums of money of Return Jonathan Fairport.On the present occasion he called upon him and told him he wanted to borrow a large sum.    Lack-a-day,    said Jonathan,    I am just at this time hard up.
 >> I have not one hundred dollars at command.

 >> Where in the world can I get a thousand dollars?

 >> I am this moment racking my brains to meet a draft from Boston of $500.       
Pooh!    said St. John,    I understand your tricks, brother Jonathan; you need not attempt to play them on me.I know you can command any sum you choose.Don't talk to me of one thousand dollars, I want at least fifteen thousand!    Fairport raised his hands and gazed at St. John with astonishment.    Fifteen thousand,    said he,    I could not, to save the nation, raise five thousand.       D   n it,    said St. John,    let me hear no more of this; you know that I know what you say is false.       What has Major St. John seen of me,    replied Fairport, meekly,    which causes him to charge me with falsehood?truly he knows I am a conscientious man.

Soon after this, I was hired out to Mr. Walker; the same man whom I have mentioned as having carried a gang of slaves down the river, on the steamboat Enterprize.Seeing me in the capacity of steward on the boat, and thinking that I would make a good hand to take care of slaves, he determined to have me for that purpose; and finding that my master would not sell me, he hired me for the term of one year.
When I learned the fact of my having been hired to a negro speculator, or a    soul-driver    as they are generally called among slaves, no one can tell my emotions.

My answer was, You can use your influence with our master, and have us set free.He replied thus:    If I were to hire you my horse, could you sell it without my leave?You are another man's property, and I have not money sufficient to buy all of you, and set you free.    At that moment I cocked my gun; but there being no priming in it, I bit off a piece of cartridge, and, going to prime it, I for the first time discovered it was not loaded.Had my gun been loaded, doubtless Jackson would have been a dead man in a moment.There was no fear in my soul, at that time, of anything, neither man, death, nor mortal.The war-blood was up.I had just two days before cut off the heads of six brave Englishmen, and Jackson's life, at that moment, appeared no more to me than theirs.It was well for him that he took the precaution to have our guns unloaded when in the ammunition house.His guilty conscience smote him, and told him he was doing us a great piece of injustice, in promising us, by the most solemn protestation, that we should be free if the victory were gained.
 >> I would then have shot him dead a thousand times, if that could have been done.

 >> My soul was stirred in me, and maddened to desperation, to think that we had placed our lives in such imminent peril, through the persuasions of such false-heartedness, and now told to go back home to our masters!

 >> Jackson asked me if I contended for freedom.
I said I did.He said,    I think you are very presumptuous.    I told him, the time had come for us to claim our rights.He said,    You promised me that you would fight manfully.    I did, sir, and now is the time for me to claim the benefit of the promise you made me. I did fight manfully and gained the victory, now where is my freedom?He replied, as he had nothing else to reply,    You are a day too late; and if you are not willing to go home, I will put you in confinement, and send for your master; he will take you home; you seem to be the hardest among the whole crew.    Some of the whites standing round said,    He ought to be shot.

## CONTEXT: 

The first summer after I returned to Rochester, the friends of temperance made a fine celebration, and gave me the privilege of providing the dinner.
I considered it not only a privilege, but an honor, and felt very grateful to the committee who conferred the favor upon me.
The celebration came off on the Fourth of July, and was indeed a splendid affair.The multitude were addressed on the public square, by some of the best speakers in the country.I laid in a large quantity of provisions of every available kind, built a bower, hired waiters, and prepared seats for five hundred to dine; but when the oration was over, and the multitude came to the table, I found that as many more seats were wanted.We, however, accommodated as many as we could, at one dollar each, and all passed off well, to the great satisfaction of all concerned.
When all was over, and the friends learned that I had on hand a large amount of cooked provision, they continued their kindness by purchasing it, thus preventing any loss on my part.
My store on the corner of Main and North Streets, was at the head of the market, and I was enabled to supply both of my stores with country produce on the best possible terms.I kept two clerks at each store, and all seemed prosperous for a time, when from some cause, which I could never understand, my business began to fail.My family had ever lived prudently, and I knew that was not the cause.
 >> I thought to better my circumstances by taking a store in the Rochester House, but that proved to be a bad stand for my business, and after one year, I removed to Buffalo Street, opposite the Court House.

 >> I ought to say, that as soon as I found that my income was getting less than my expenses, I went to the gentlemen who had loaned me the five hundred dollars, and showed them the true state of my affairs, and they kindly agreed to take fifty per cent., which I paid them.

 >> After locating on Buffalo Street, I took in a partner, named John Lee, a young man, active and industrious, who paid into the firm three hundred dollars, with which we bought goods.
With what I had on hand, this raised the joint stock to about a thousand dollars, which we were making frequent additions, and on which we had an insurance of six hundred dollars.Our business was now more prosperous than at any previous time, and we began to look up with hope and confidence in our final success.One night I returned to my home as usual, leaving Lee in the store.About twelve o'clock, Mr. Morris awoke me with a few loud raps, and the announcement that my store was on fire and a part of my goods in the street!I hastened to the place, where I found, as he had said, what was saved from the fire piled up in the street and the fire extinguished.The building was greatly damaged and the goods they rescued were nearly ruined.Now we were thrown out of business, and the firm was dissolved.With the assistance of W. S. Bishop, a lawyer, we made out the amount of damage, which was readily paid by the agent for the insurance company.

I am happy to say this day's work was a blessing to me.
I have been around again, but did not meet with as much success as on yesterday.I tried once more to see the Governor, but he sent word for me to please excuse him, he was so very busy.Accordingly I left.
I went to the holiness meeting and listened to a very interesting discourse.The speaker undoubtedly understood what he was talking about.He held his audience spell-bound for some time.
I came in contact with a brother who said he was an evangelist.He spoke much of his belief, but I did not agree with everything he said.He declared it was wrong to eat hog's flesh.
 >> I reminded him that God said to Peter,    What I have cleansed, let no man call common or unclean.      

 >> I shall eat as much pork as I feel disposed to,    said I.   I don't eat any of it,    said he.   

 >> You have a right to do as you please about that,    I said,    and so have I. Hog meat is the best for the poor laboring man, in the hot sun; it makes him slick and greasy, so the sun cannot burn him.   
So we had a very pleasant conversation, then bade each other adieu.
I am going to try it again to-day.I have been trying it.I went up first on an elevator, and again on another, and found some of the most clever spoken young ladies in these rooms that I ever had the pleasure of meeting   they were very polite in speaking to me.One of them gave me fifty cents, and appeared to be exceedingly happy because she did so.I thanked her ever so much for her contribution, and incouraged her to do likewise to some one else.I did not sell a book, but I collected a little money.
Myself, Supple and a white brother, who occupies the same room, went to the Baptist church, just across the street, to a prayer-meeting that was in session.

## CONTEXT: 

He had nothing to do with the fires and massacres of August, 1791; but joined the insurgents as soon he was convinced that they had a principle of union, and an end in view.
Many of the Planters had made their escape from the island, and fled with their families to foreign countries; but the master of Toussaint was one, who, not having made an early retreat, was on the point of falling into the hands of the infuriated Blacks; but his humane and beneficent treatment of this worthy Slave was not forgotten.When the plantation on which Toussaint had served was endangered by the approach of the Negro forces, with considerable care and ingenuity, and at the risk of his own life, he secured the safety of his master and family, by secreting them in the woods for several days, and finally provided for their escape from the island, by putting them on board an American vessel, with a considerable quantity of produce, on which the fugitives might be enabled to support themselves in exile.Nor did his gratitude end here: after their settlement at Baltimore, he availed himself of every opportunity of making them such remittances, as he could snatch from the wreck of their property, frequently sending them some additional proof of his gratitude and friendship.Conduct so noble, in the midst of such barbarities as were then enacting, indicated great originality and moral independence of character.
Having performed what he considered to be an act of duty, in providing for the safety of his master, Toussaint, who had now no tie to retain him longer in servitude, perceiving both reason and justice in the struggle which his oppressed race were making to regain their liberty, attached himself to the body of Negroes.Presenting himself to the Black General, Jean Fran  ois, he was received into the army, in which he at once assumed a leading rank.A certain amount of medical knowledge, derived in the course of his reading, enabled him to unite the functions of physician with those of military officer, and he was called physician to the forces.He soon rose from the rank of aide-de-camp to that of colonel.
The army he had joined was under royalist commanders in the Spanish part of the island, and was opposed to the French republican planters.
 >> He knew and cared little for the state of parties in France: he was fighting for his Black brethren against their White oppressors, and for a long time he was not aware that he was affording his favour in testimony of the same despotic principles in France, which he was contending against in St. Domingo.

 >> Toussaint was posted at Marmalade, with his Negro troops, under the command of a Spanish general, when he heard of the Decree of the French Convention, of February 4th, 1794, which confirmed and proclaimed the liberty of all Slaves, and declared St. Domingo to be an integral part of France.

 >> This news opened his eyes to the truth, that in opposing the republicans he was fighting against the freedom of the Blacks.
He lost no time in opening a communication with Laveaux, the republican commander; and in a few days joined him with a considerable Negro force, delivering up several Spanish posts of great importance.The Spanish general, Hermona, had exclaimed, a few days before, on seeing Toussaint receive the sacrament, that God never visited a purer spirit; but now, confusion and terror reigned among the Spaniards, and the name of the Negro commander was reviled as it had before been honoured.It is hinted by historians that ambition was one cause of the defection of Toussaint; that he had little hope of rising to the rank held by Jean Fran  ois in the Spanish forces, while he hoped for a great addition to his honours from the French general.Laveaux made him brigadier-general, but watched all his movements, fearing that a man who had once changed sides might be liable to change again.
The power which Toussaint speedily obtained over the ignorant and barbarous soldiery, (the released Slaves, whom he commanded,) was indeed wonderful enough to fix the attention of all who were around him,   the wisest and most experienced of whom were as much under the spell of his influence as the most degraded.It was by his observation of men's minds, and by his own decision of character, that he obtained this influence.He had not yet had the opportunity of showing valour: he was so far from eloquent that his words were few, and the utterance of them awkward and difficult; he had but just emerged from Slavery.But he knew that the Blacks wanted a leader, and he felt that he was the leader they wanted; and this conviction gave him a confidence in arrangement and action, which made him the master of all the minds about him.

## CONTEXT: 

The boat was burned because it was employed by the filibusters to carry men and arms and provisions from the American to the Canadian side.
The invasion of Canada on one side, and of the States on the other, and the slaughter of men on both sides, created intense excitement on the frontiers, and fears were entertained by some, that the passions provoked by these harebrained invaders, might mingle in the politics of the country, and bring on a general war.
The colored population of Canada at that time was small, compared to what it now is; nevertheless, it was sufficiently large to attract the attention of the Government.They were almost, to a man, fugitive, slaves from the States.They could not, therefore, be passive, when the success of the invaders would break the only arm interposed for their security, and destroy the only asylum for African freedom in North America.The promptness with which several companies of blacks were organized and equipped, and the desperate valor they displayed in this brief conflict, are an earnest of what may be expected from the swelling thousands of colored fugitives collecting there, in the event of a war between the two countries.
We write of facts, not of possibilities.Nevertheless, we may assert what is allowed on the other side of the lines, that these able-bodied and daring refugees are the most reliable fortress of national strength on the Canadian frontiers; and ere it is scaled by slave-holders or their abettors, a tale will be told that will make the ear that hears it tingle.And should pro-slavery folly and persistence raise the spirit of the North, or of any part of the country, to the point that admits the African element in a war for freedom, the blacks of Canada will be found overleaping national boundaries; and, gathering the sympathizing forces in the line of march, will imprint upon the soil of slavery as bloody a lesson as was ever written.
We have alluded to this flare-up on the frontiers, by way of introduction to the following fact.

 >> During the same winter, Mr. Loguen went over to St. Catharines to dispose of his house and lot, of which we have before spoken.

 >> At this time, though the forces were still under arms, the back bone of the invasion was fairly broken, by the interference of the Government of the United States.**

 >> Inasmuch as the fillibusters made this assault on Canada without authority of any nation, State, or political power whatever, they were properly regarded by the Provincials as Pirates, and the captives were shot, or hung, or sent to Botany Bay.
And inasmuch, also, as they were American citizens, who thus organized, equipped, and embarked from the United States, against a people at peace with Them, they were subject to the penalties provided by Congress against such offenders.President Van Buren issued his proclamation for their rigid prosecution, and notified those who were or might be captured, that they would be left, without protection or sympathy, to the mercy of the Government they assailed.The fillibusters were thus promptly taught that incursions for the conquest of northern Territory were less adapted to the national taste, than like forays for the conquest of Texas, Mexico, Cuba, and the Isthmus.The instant and decided check given to this northern move, effectually curbed unlawful enterprizes in that direction; and the only vent for national passions in this regard, has been found to lay at the South.The only prospect of increasing the slave power in the Senate and in Congress is that way, and there its attractions are irresistable.Nevertheless, while there he was urgently solicited by the Government of Canada to accept the captaincy of a company of black troops in the Provincial Army.We mention this fact, to show the estimate he had attained for fidelity, bravery, judgment, and manly conduct.But because the war had very nearly closed, and his brethren and friends were therefore out of danger   and because he was profitably employed at his home in Rochester, he respectfully declined the compliment, and having sold his lot, returned to his engagements.

## CONTEXT: 

The professor has a funny way of putting some things, and so I end this sketch with an extract from a speech made in St. Albans, Vermont, in 1880.It has an amusing turn which for quaintness and point rather causes a smile when read.
   THE BENEFIT OF THE NEGRO'S COLOR.   
He denied the statement that the Negroes were not an original race; they were largely imitative, he admitted, but there were three of the white men's vices which his people did not imitate   they were not skeptics, they were not infidels, and they did not commit suicide.Then he quoted a certain bit of philosophy, illustrating the advantages the race had on this question of suicide, namely: White reflects light, and therefore the face of the white man reflects the light, and he goes through life a melancholy creature; while the face of the black man absorbs light, which penetrates to his soul and makes him a glad, careless, jolly creature.Just here Mr. Ensley applied this same bit of philosophy to Whittaker, the West Point cadet.Now Whittaker, says the speaker, is three parts white and two parts black; if he had been a black man, he would never have injured himself   as the court, you remember, decided that he did mutilate himself; if he had been a white man, he would have hung himself; but as he was neither white nor black, why he hurt himself just a little.
The professor aspires to the poet's chair, and communes occasionally with the muses.I give here a short poem, simply to show the trend of his mind.It was written for the Roger Williams' Record, April, 1886.

 >> WRITE THY NAME.

 >> Write your name upon the sand,The waves will wash it out again.

 >> Trace it on the crystal foam,No sooner is it writ than gone.
Carve it in the solid oak,
'Tis shattered by the lightning's stroke.
Chisel it in marble deep,
'Twill crumble down   it cannot keep.


Seeker for the sweets of fame,
On things so frail, write not thy name.
With thee 'twill wither, die, rot;
On things so frail, then, write it not.
Would'st thou have thy name endure?
Go, write it in the Book of Life,
Engrave it on the hearts of men,
By humble deeds performed in love.

## CONTEXT: 

These latter, by an arrangement entered into with the commissioners, are received into this Home for a season, or until they are healed of their sicknesses and able to resume employment   thus they are rescued from much suffering and destitution, being cared for, instructed in the right way, lifted up from degradation and wretchedness, and encouraged to habits of industry and propriety.
The Managers contemplate, so soon as their means will justify them, erecting a chapel, or a building with chapel accommodations, and school-room, for the instruction of the inmates who choose to avail themselves of the privilege of learning to read and write.They have also accommodation rooms for workshops, where the inmates of the Home, not incapacitated by illness or infirmities, may be taught some handicraft which may be a source of profit to them after leaving the Institution, enabling them to support themselves by their industry.
We have commenced this work in faith; trusting that the public will contribute to our aid to enable us to carry out our plans of operation.The enterprise certainly commends itself to the judgment and liberality of our humane citizens, to whom we look for encouragement, sincerely trusting we shall not be disappointed.
M. W. T.NEW-YORK, 1851.
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
THE original cause of all suffering is sin.It is this that has    brought death into the world, with all our woe.    The fact is established by the experience of every age.

 >> To the Christian, the sufferings of this life, however painful and severe, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed.

 >> Having passed through all its sorrows, its toils, and its deprivations, he rejoices when    The soft peace-march beatsHome! brothers, Home!   

 >> Notwithstanding the suffering which all are called to endure, while passing through this vale of tears   some more, some less   it is yet pleasant to know, that much of this anguish and misery can be alleviated, soothed, and made more endurable, by the exercise of sympathy and kindness.
For the true illustration of these Christian virtues, and to confirm us in our devotion, we have a perfect pattern for our imitation in Christ, who bore our sins in His own body on the tree.Thus, having the embodied testimony of Him, whose earthly pilgrimage was, that    He went about doing good,    Christians are bound to carry out the Divine intention bequeathed by Him whose mission was mercy, and whose precepts and example are obligatory on all who profess to be His followers.
Jesus left no duty unfulfilled: nor may His children leave undone the work that He hath given them to do.They are to imitate Him in all His imitable perfections; not that 'tis possible that their devotion can ever equal His, nor that they can thereby make themselves meritorious in the sight of God: nay   but because He hath commanded us to tread in His foot-prints, and taught, that    herein is His Father glorified, that we bear much fruit,    is the heart that from love to Him desires His glory, impelled to pray, and toil, and struggle, that by its obedience Christ may be glorified, and wretched men be blest.
Christian sympathy is no dull, inoperative principle; no bidding    Be ye warmed and clothed,    the while it shutteth up its bowels of compassion; it is not satisfied with a mere knowledge of its duty; but awakened at the cross, where it is made immeasurably a debtor.As Jesus did, it seeks the poor, the destitute, the suffering, that it may minister to their necessities and sorrows, and, if possible, assuage their woes.
Jesus sought the wretched and lost; His mercy was extended to all ranks and conditions of men; none were too humble for His eye of kingly love   none too depraved and fallen for His compassion.His presence, though He was the King of kings, won to His healing lip and hand the sorrow-stricken and the poor.

I began, too, to feel my own resolution giving way.Freedom had ever been an object of my ambition, though no other means of obtaining it had occurred to me but purchasing myself.I had never dreamed of running away.I had a sentiment of honour on the subject.The duties of the slave to his master as appointed over him in the Lord, I had ever heard urged by ministers and religious men.Entrancing as the ideas were, that the coast was clear for a run for freedom, that I might liberate my companions, might carry off my wife and children, and some day own a house and land, and be no longer despised and abused, still my notions of right were against it.I had promised my master to take his property to Kentucky, and deposit it with his brother Amos.Pride, too, came in to confirm me.I had undertaken a great thing; my vanity had been flattered all along the road by hearing myself praised; I thought it would be a feather in my cap to carry it through thoroughly, and had often painted the scene in my imagination of the final surrender of my charge to Master Amos, and the immense admiration and respect with which he would regard me.
Under the influence of these impressions, and seeing that the allurements of the crowd were producing a manifest effect, I sternly assumed the captain, and ordered the boat to be pushed off into the stream.
 >> A shower of curses followed me from the shore; but the negroes under me, accustomed to obey, and, alas! too degraded and ignorant of the advantages of liberty to know what they were forfeiting, offered no resistance to my command.

 >> Often since that day has my soul been pierced with bitter anguish, at the thought of having been thus instrumental in consigning to the infernal bondage of slavery, so many of my fellow-beings.

 >> I have wrestled in prayer with God for forgiveness.
Having experienced myself the sweetness of liberty, and knowing too well the after-misery of a number of these slaves, my infatuation has often seemed to me to have been the unpardonable sin.But I console myself with the thought that I acted according to my best light, though the light that was in me was darkness.Those were my days of ignorance.I knew not then the glory of free manhood, or that the title-deed of the slave-owner is robbery and outrage.
What advantages I may have personally lost by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom!But the perception of my own strength of character, the feeling of integrity, the sentiment of high honour, I thus gained by obedience to what I believed right, are advantages which I prize.He that is faithful over a little, will be faithful over much.Before God I tried to do my best, and the error of judgment lies at the door of the degrading system under which I had been nurtured.

## CONTEXT: 

What such service is; what it consists in.
In giving to Christ and His service our purest and deepest affection   love.
Where there is love, there is interest, keen, inspiring, lasting.Affliction becomes light and duties sweet.
The soul that feeds on love grows upon what it feeds, and such a soul is on the road to a frame of mind and state of being, where it can largely realize and appreciate the lofty sentiments of the ancient Hebrew rabbis expressed in the words:

   Joy is duty, so with golden lore,
The Hebrew rabbis taught in days of yore.
And happy human hearts heard in their speech
Almost the highest wisdom man can reach.   

Yet still rising far above is the voice of one whose name is love, teaching those whom His words employ.Life is divine when duty is a joy.Joy then is the fruit of love, that greatest thing in the world which scatters seeds of kindness and sends forth rays of sunshine along life's pathway.
2.Why a life of complete and full service to Christ should be given.

 >> (a) Because God commands it.   

 >> Hear, O Israel! the Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy might.       

 >> And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.       Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do with thy might.       
Life is the time to serve the Lord; the time to insure the great reward.   
   She hath done what she could.       This measures up to the exact requirement.       She built for herself and for the world a monument and obtained the approval and the praise of Jesus.       She built better than she knew.       Jesus said:    Verily I say unto you wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also, that this woman hathe done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.      
3.How a life of complete and full service to Christ is to be given.

## CONTEXT: 

It was Jimmie's duty   in addition to the work he did on the farm   to go twice a week   Wednesdays and Saturdays   to Mr. Chris Player's, two miles away, for the mail, and to bring up the cows and sheep.Hence Jimmie never made a full hand on the farm, but worked when he was not needed for other duties.
But there is another interesting incident in the life of this youth, which the author cannot fail to relate.It occurred when he was about fifteen years of age.In the spring of 1865 the War between the States ended.The result was, all the slaves became free.A contract was signed by master and slaves to remain together the balance of that year and finish the crop.
It was now in the fall of that year, and the crops were being gathered.The children and young folks were sent to the field to pick peas.Jimmie was one of the number.
 >> The field was in sight of the white folks' house.

 >> From this house the white folks had a splendid view of these youngsters.

 >> They worked tolerably well until toward sundown, when they became very playful and frolicsome.
From the house, the white folks saw their pranks.But nothing was said, yet they noticed that young    Mas Dolphus    was coming toward them with his double-barrel shotgun on his shoulder.They suspected nothing; but supposed that he was going on a squirrel hunt, as he was wont to do in the cool of the afternoons.As a matter of course, the youngsters all sobered down to work   seeing    Mas Dolphus    coming.And not a word was spoken, until he walked right up to Jimmie, and drew from under his coat a long whip, and began to lay it on him.The young master uttered these awful words as he continued to hit Jimmie:    Run if you dare, and I'll blow your brains out.    Of course, the sight of the gun, and the threatening words of the young master had a decided effect in taming this young freedman.He stood and took it as good naturedly as he possibly could.

## CONTEXT: 

The little girl, on her way home, had to cross a run, or brook, which led down into the swamp; when she came to the brook she followed it into the swamp, then took the infant and plunged it head foremost into the water and mud, where it stuck fast; she there left it and went to the negro quarters.When the mother came in from the field, she asked the girl where the child was; she told her she had brought it home, but did not know where it was; the overseer was immediately informed, search was made, and it was found as above stated, and dead.The little girl was shut up in the barn, and confined there two or three weeks, when a speculator came along and bought her for two hundred dollars.
The slaves are obliged to work from daylight till dark, as long as they can see.When they have tasks assigned, which is often the case, a few of the strongest and most expert, sometimes finish them before sunset; others will be obliged to work till eight or nine o'clock in the evening.All must finish their tasks or take a flogging.The whip and gun, or pistol, are companions of the overseer; the former he uses very frequently upon the negroes, during their hours of labor, without regard to age or sex.Scarcely a day passed while I was on the plantation, in which some of the slaves were not whipped; I do not mean that they were struck a few blows merely, but had a set flogging.The same labor is commonly assigned to men and women,   such as digging ditches in the rice marshes, clearing up land, chopping cord-wood, threshing, &c. I have known the women go into the barn as soon as they could see in the morning, and work as late as they could see at night, threshing rice with the flail, (they now have a threshing machine,) and when they could see to thresh no longer, they had to gather up the rice, carry it up stairs, and deposit it in the granary.
The allowance of clothing on this plantation to each slave, was given out at Christmas for the year, and consisted of one pair of coarse shoes, and enough coarse cloth to make a jacket and trowsers.
 >> If the man has a wife she makes it up; if not, it is made up in the house.

 >> The slaves on this plantation, being near Wilmington, procured themselves extra clothing by working Sundays and moonlight nights, cutting cord-wood in the swamps, which they had to back about a quarter of a mile to the river; they would then get a permit from their master, and taking the wood in their canoes, carry it to Wilmington, and sell it to the vessels, or dispose of it as they best could, and with the money buy an old jacket of the sailors, some coarse cloth for a shirt, &c. They sometimes gather the moss from the trees, which they cleanse and take to market.

 >> The women receive their allowance of the same kind of cloth which the men have.
This they make into a frock; if they have any under garments they must procure them for themselves.When the slaves get a permit to leave the plantation, they sometimes make all ring again by singing the following significant ditty, which shows that after all there is a flow of spirits in the human breast which for a while, at least, enables them to forget their wretchedness.** Slaves sometimes sing, and so do convicts in jails under sentence, and both for the same reason.Their singing proves that they want to be happy not that they are so.It is the means that they use to make themselves happy, not the evidence that they are so already.Sometimes, doubtless, the excitement of song whelms their misery in momentary oblivion.He who argues from this that they have no conscious misery to forget, knows as little of human nature as of slavery.   EDITOR.

He giv me de pass to go to de city
Hurra, for good ole Missis,

## CONTEXT: 

During a march, when our troops neared a plantation, the slaves would eagerly join them.In many instances in plundering the houses slaves were found locked up.Continually during this raiding expedition, slaves came pouring in from the country in every direction, with their household furniture, thronging the lately deserted streets.This expedition was to search out guerrillas, lurking about the neighborhood of Elizabeth City and firing on our pickets.A force of colored men fell on their camp.There was a hasty escapade, and the soldiers came in possession of fire-arms and horses.Leaving Elizabeth City, they passed by vast fields of corn a mile in extent, commodious looking buildings and magnificent plantations.Here the troops commenced to work in earnest, and became an army of liberation.
On the first plantation they found fourteen slaves, who gladly joined them.An old wagon was found, to which a horse was harnessed.
 >> Such furniture as the slaves needed was placed in it, and the women and children on top.

 >> And so they went from house to house, gathering together the slaves, and whatever teams and horses could be found.

 >> Meanwhile, foraging went on, as there was an abundance of geese, chickens and turkeys.
All the planters were    Secesh,    so no restrictions were placed on the troops.The line of march continued, the contraband train continually growing in length.
At Indian Town bridge Gen. Wild came upon a guerrilla camp.His men started upon the    double quick,    and pursued them through woods, across corn fields, until they came to a swamp.Here no path whatever could be seen, and how the guerrillas succeeded in covering their flight was, at first, a mystery; but our men were in for it now, and did not intend to turn back before ferreting out the matter.They began a careful search, and soon found the trunk of a felled tree, well-worn with footsteps.Near by was another, then another till they made quite a zig-zag footpath across the swamp.This solved the mystery.

We will now listen to a limited number of the precepts and sayings of the Old Testament:   
   Proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto all the inhabitants thereof!   
   Let the oppressed go free!   
   Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.   
   Thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty, but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.   
   The wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.   
   Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.   
   Execute judgment and justice, take away your exaction from my people, saith the Lord God.   
   Do justice to the afflicted and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked.   
   Therefore, thus saith the Lord, Ye have not hearkened unto me it, proclaiming liberty every one to his brother, every man to his neighbor.Behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, to the famine, and I will make you to be renowned in all the kingdoms of the earth.   
   He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.   
   
 >> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry, and shall not be heard.      

 >> He that oppresseth the poor, reproacheth his Maker.      

 >> I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.   
We select a few precepts and sayings from the New Testament:   
   Call no man master, neither be ye called master.   
   All things whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.   
   Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another.   
   Do good to all men as ye have opportunity.   
   If thou mayest be made free, use it rather.   
   The laborer is worthy of his hire.   
But to return to our narrative.Besides these religious privileges enjoyed by Lunsford, he had some dear friends among the better informed and religious people of Raleigh, who were looking with interest at his struggles to release himself from bondage.

## CONTEXT: 

Where have you been?    said he.Poor Lydia now burst into tears, and said,    I only stopped to talk awhile to this man,    pointing to me;    but indeed, master overseer, I will never do so again.       Lie down,    was his reply.Lydia immediately fell prostrate upon the ground; and in this position he compelled her to remove her old tow linen shift, the only garment she wore, so as to expose her hips, when he gave her ten lashes, with his long whip, every touch of which brought blood, and a shriek from the sufferer.He then ordered her to go and get her supper, with an injunction never to stay behind again.- The other three culprits were then put upon their trial.
The first was a middle aged woman, who had, as her overseer said, left several hills of cotton in the course of the day, without cleaning and hilling them in a proper manner.She received twelve lashes.The other two were charged in general terms, with having been lazy, and of having neglected their work that day.Each of these received twelve lashes.

 >> These people all received punishment in the same manner that it had been inflicted upon Lydia, and when they were all gone the overseer turned to me and said -    Boy, you are a stranger here yet, but I called you in to let you see how things are done here, and to give you a little advice.

 >> When I get a new negro under my command, I never whip at first; I always give him a few days to learn his duty, unless he is an outrageous villain, in which case I anoint him a little at the beginning.

 >> I call over the names of all the hands twice every week, on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, and settle with them according to their general conduct for the last three days.
I call the names of my captains every morning, and it is their business to see that they have all their hands in their proper places.You ought not to have staid behind to-night with Lyd; but as this is your first offence, I shall overlook it, and you may go and get your supper.    I made a low bow, and thanked master overseer for his kindness to me, and left him.This night for supper we had corn bread and cucumbers; but we had neither salt, vinegar, nor pepper with the cucumbers.
I had never before seen people flogged in the way our overseer flogged his people.This plan of making the person who is to be whipped lie down upon the ground, was new to me, though it is much practiced in the South; and I have since seen men, and women too, cut nearly in pieces by this mode of punishment.It has one advantage over tying people up by the hands, as it prevents all accidents from sprains in the thumbs or wrists.
On Monday morning I heard the sound of the horn at the usual hour, and repairing to the front of the overseer's house, found that he had already gone to the corn crib, for the purpose of distributing corn among the people, for the bread of the week; or rather for the week's subsistence, for this corn was all the provision that our master, or his overseer, usually made for us; I say usually, for whatever was given to us beyond the corn, which we received on Sunday evening, was considered in the light of a bounty bestowed upon us, over and beyond what we were entitled to, or had a right to expect to receive.

I can call to mind when she the blessed one, that I call my white mother, went to get me some shoes and a fine hat, and the one that sold them told her, as she looked at a hat I wanted, that its price was twenty dollars, but I was not thinking of the prices then as I do now, and I cried to have that hat and did not want any of the others, and he told my white mother that was too much for to spend on a hat for me, but she told him nothing would cost too much for her to get for me, and she got that fine hat for me and he had his money; so you can see how much she loved me.And now that dear one is gone from me, and it seemed the dearest one on this earth, and I did not think then that I could have lived without her whom God had given to me for this world, but God, in His wonderful love for me and to me, raised up friends for me and helped me to find favor in the sight of all the people, for they seemed to love me for her sake, and I did not get well for a long time.
This subject came to this dear lady, Mrs. Bettie House, when but three years old, and from the day she came to that house she walked in her footsteps, for she, Mrs. House, could not move, but she was right in the way; and when she used to set me down for my play at certain times in the day, when she was going in her room for prayer, she would find me near before she was through; and if ever there was a loving woman she was one, and I owe my love to God for such a one as she was to care for me all of those nights of watching by my bed, while the angels watched from above to see that I should rise from that bed and live to be a woman that would live for God and bless His name in all the earth, knowing that I am tempted and tried on every hand.But trusting in His omnipotent power I shall reach the land of the blest where that dear one has gone to come out no more forever.
Well, to my story:
Dear public, hoping that this little life will be read with the greatest love for humanity, and I am sure that if you have any love for the God of heaven you can not fail to find a love for this book, and I hope you will find a fullness of joy in reading this life, for if your heart was like a stone you would like to read this little life.
I had many a hard spell of sickness since the death of this lady and the doctors said that I could not live beyond a certain time, but every time they said so Doctor Jesus said she shall live, for because I live she shall live also; and He came to me and laid His strong arm around me and raised me up by the power of His might, and to see the salvation of our God in the land of the living.And to-day I can praise His name for His wonderful love to the children of man.
I told you that my brother was the oldest child of eighteen and he was in his teens when he was sent to the war; and it was a great thing to him when he found himself in the hands of a people that were so kind and good to him and showing such love for him, after being knocked around by those he had been staying with, and it seemed like a heaven to him; and he did learn fast, and he felt so glad to learn to read and to write, and he would sit at nights when he was through with his daily toil and write, so that he could let some one look at it and see how well he was getting along, and I saw how anxious he was to get an education.I asked my lady to let him come there and wait on the table, and have time to go every day to school, and she did so, and he would go to No. 1 School to Mr. C. Dosey, and he did nicely in his studies, and God be praised that he had that much to take home with him, and I shall always feel glad that I gave him that much.
I was thinking of my dear brother when the news reached me that he was in this city, and I can never tell any one how glad that I was to see the only boy that my mother ever had, for we all loved him dearly, as he cared for all the rest of the children and it was no more than natural that we should; and my mother thought so much of him that she often would say if we were all boys she would not have to worry, for boys could do so much better than girls.
 >> But I think that she found that the girls were the best in her old age, for if one could not be near her the other would, and if there is a time in the life of a parent it is when they are helpless, and a boy is not any good to care for a sick parent and they have to go without care.

 >> But God be praised for all of the love and honor that was bestowed on mother before she went home, for God has told us to honor our fathers and our mothers that their days may be long upon the land which the Lord, thy God, giveth thee; and we can not do them enough honor for the love and the all-night watching that we have when we are babies, and if we have all of the love and care that I had, I am sure that a mother has her hands full; and when now I think of the care and the worry that it was to take care of my sick body

 >> . I can not help telling some one of it, that they may feel as grateful as I feel, for God did give them love for me, and if there is one that should feel grateful it is this feeble-bodied slave girl, for I was such a slave to sickness, and God was so good to raise me, even me, and I will say, praise His name.
I was telling you of my white mother being so true to the attendance in the services of God, and I only wish that you could have known her as I did, for she was more like one of the heavenly host than she was like us, who are such sinful creatures.Now, it seems like sometimes that we have not much love for the One who had so much love for us that He gave all the dear One, that He had to bring us to to Himself, that we should taste of those joys which He has for those who have washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb.
The Lord helped me to find love and favor with all after my white mother was gone from this earth, when I felt that I would soon follow the darling one to the blessed mansion; and I would look to see her come to me, and I went as soon as I was well to the house and lay on the steps, and it was not until we had left the dear old place before I could be kept from there; and I wish that the whole world could have seen how much she was like an angel, and I would to God she could see me to-day; it would do you good.Lord, lead me on day by day, and help my feeble life to be formed like her's, for when I think how she used to watch by my bed at nights, while the angels watched by my bed from on high to see that I should rise; and is not God the One that I should serve?And I love to serve Him and honor Him, for He is my all in all; for she has shown me how great her love was for me and all of humanity, and I love to think of her love and to know how wonderful it would be to see her sweet face on this green earth, and it does seem to me as if I could almost see her by thinking of her so much.
I have said that we came to this lovely city in the year of our Lord 1865, and in that year I went to live with a good family that were members of the church, where the Lord spoke peace to my soul, under the preaching of the Rev. David Moore, then the beloved leader of the noblest band of God's children on this earth and a more beloved people never lived.They were always on the lookout for any strangers that might come in the church, and they soon found me out as I was a stranger in the Monday night meeting.The dear pastor came to me the first one, for he did not stop to think whether I was an African or what nation I had come from, but he saw in me a soul, and he wanted to find out if there was any room for Jesus to live or what I should do with Jesus, or what should I do for Him, who had done so much for me; and my poor heart was ready and waiting for some one to come to its rescue.

CHICAGO, Nov. 2d.
MY DEAR LIZZIE:   Your letter of last Wednesday is received, and I cannot refrain from expressing my surprise that before now K. and B. did not go out in search of names, and have sent forth all those circulars.Their conduct is becoming mysterious.
 >> We have heard enough of their talk   it is time now they should be acting.

 >> Their delay, I fear, has ruined the business.

 >> The circulars should all have been out before the election.
I cannot understand their slowness.As Mr. Greeley's home is in New York, he could certainly have been found had he been sought; and there are plenty of other good men in New York, as well as himself.I venture to say, that before the election not a circular will be sent out.I begin to think they are making a political business of my clothes, and not for my benefit either.Their delay in acting is becoming very suspicious.Their slow, bad management is ruining every prospect of success.I fear you are only losing your time in New York, and that I shall be left in debt for what I am owing the firm.I have written to K. and B., and they do nothing that I request.

The second impression I wanted corrected, was that I was not complaining because of what Mr. Vinell gave me, for I considered him the only rightful possessor of the purse and contents.When my many friends learned that I was the person who had found the money, they came together and presented me with a present of some two hundred dollars.
I accepted Mr. Vinell's invitation and made him a visit at the Cape, which was very pleasant and profitable, and through his influence I was able to solicit the sympathy and co-operation of several friends in the southern work.
If there is any moral to this pocket-book story, it is this: Honesty is always the best policy, and brings its own reward.
CHAPTER XIII.
RETROSPECT.
THE river has its bend and the longest road must terminate.As I look backward and take a retrospective view of my past toils and sorrows, and the vicissitudes through which I have passed, I feel that I have much to be thankful for.I am greatful to Almighty God for emancipation from cruel southern bondage, and for directing my course to liberty-loving Massachusetts.I am thankful to that noble band of men and women who, by pen and tongue acting under the highest impulse, did not hesitate to perform their duty in behalf of outraged and oppressed humanity
 >> .I shall never forget those brave and patriotic men who, tearing themselves from the embrace of their families, hastened to the scene of conflict and poured out their dearest blood for freedom and right.

 >> I thank God for the unity and good feeling that exist between the North and South; for the material prosperity of which we have a right to boast; and join with others in the grand anthems of praise:   My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty,       God bless our native land,    and,    Firm may she ever stand.   

 >> But, with all my gratitude and praise, I still feel ashamed of the present condition of our colored Americans, in this great country.
A candid review of that condition will show that it is far from what it ought to be, in view of the great loss of blood and treasure.
The sacrifices and insults that the anti-slavery folks were forced to endure, the suffering and privations of the soldiers on the battle-field, and in prison pens; the loss of over a million lives, and eight billions of money, should have been sufficient to dig a grave so deep for slavery, that it would never rise again to vex the country in any form.
Doubtless there are many who think this has been done, and done once for all.I sincerely hope so.
But, as in the days of slavery, so now, I hear the voice of my oppressed brethren in the South, crying for help and protection.Protection from the lash, shot-gun, lynching, and that most fiendish custom   which was unknown in the days of slavery   the burning of colored people alive at the stake.These, my outraged brethren, have again and again waited upon the President through their delegations, and presented to him their grievances, The delegations have been politely received, only to be informed that the President could do nothing.They have returned to their homes to be abused the more for daring to complain of the treatment accorded them by the white South.

SARAH BOSS, a poor black widow, was active in voluntary and benevolent services.
A poor black man, named SAMPSON, went constantly from house to house, giving assistance every where gratuitously, until he was seized with the fever and died.
MARY SCOTT, a woman of color, attended Mr. Richard Mason and his son so kindly and disinterestedly, that the widow, Mrs. R. Mason, settled an annuity of six pounds upon her for life.
An elderly black nurse, going about most diligently and affectionately, when asked what pay she wished, used to say,    A dinner, massa, some cold winter's day.   
A young, black woman was offered any price, if she would attend a white merchant and his wife.She would take no money, but went, saying that, if she went from holy love, she might hope to be preserved, but not if she went for money.She was seized with the fever, but recovered.

 >> A black man, riding through the streets, saw a white man push a white woman out of the house.

 >> The woman staggered forward, fell in the gutter, and was too weak to rise.

 >> The black man dismounted, and took her gently to the hospital at Bush-Hill.
ABSALOM JONES and WILLIAM GRAY, the colored superintendents, say,      A white man threatened to shoot us if we passed by his house with a corpse.We buried him three days afterwards.   
About twenty times as many black nurses as white were thus employed during the sickness.
The following certificate was subsequently given by the Mayor:   
   Having, during the prevalence of the late malignant disorder, had almost daily opportunities of seeing the conduct of ABSALOM JONES and RICHARD ALLEN, and the people employed by them to bury the dead, I with cheerfulness give this testimony of my approbation of their proceedings, as far as the same came under my notice.Their diligence, attention, and decency of deportment, afforded me, at the time, much satisfaction.

 >> Hayti will be happy to meet and welcome its friends here.

 >> While the gates of the World's Columbian Exposition shall be open and shall welcome the world to this enclosure, the doors of this pavilion shall also be open and will give a warm welcome to all who shall see fit to honor us with their presence.

 >> Our emblems of welcome will be neither brandy nor wine.
No intoxicants will be served here, but we shall give all comers a generous taste of our Haytian coffee, made in the best manner by Haytian hands.They shall find this coffee pleasant in flavor and delightful in aroma.Here, as in the sunny clime of Hayti, we shall try to do honor to that country's hospitality.
   We meet to-day on the anniversary of the independence of Hayti, and it would be an unpardonable omission not to remember that fact with all honor at this time and in this place.Considering what the environments of Hayti were ninety years ago; considering the peculiar antecedents of its people, both at home and in Africa; considering their long enforced ignorance, their poverty and weakness, and their want of military training; considering their destitution of the munitions of war, and measuring the tremendous moral and material forces that confronted and opposed them, the achievement of their independence is one of the most remarkable and one of the most wonderful events in the history of this eventful country, and I may almost say in the history of mankind.I shall make no elaborate comparison of Hayti with ourselves.American independence was a task of tremendous proportions.In the contemplation of it the boldest held their breath and many brave men shrank from it appalled.

No, with few exceptions, you are too idle or too wasteful.With industry you may have as good a farm as your neighbor's.You may raise as good corn and oats, wheat and barley and rye as any man.The God of heaven sends the rains to water the earth, and my crop is watered with my neighbor.Then, I ask, why are you so far behind?You are to be a nation in time to come, let us be an industrious people.
I recommend the colored citizens of America to turn their attention more to farming than they ever have done.You can have your orchard in a few years, peaches, apples, plums, and all kind of fruit that grows.Not only so, but you can have your cattle,   see the old lady milk the cows in the morning, making ready for breakfast, while the father is looking over the field, and feeding his stock, and the little children as fat as butter.Did you see the large stock of turkies and the large stock of geese?
 >> mother raised them all in one year, we shall pluck them and make our beds, and then we shall have feathers to sell that will help father a good deal in his old age.

 >> We shall also shear our sheep, and that will be some help.

 >> Let us sell some cattle and horses, and buy another farm for James or Nancy, as they are coming up in years and will soon be of age.
Take notice, this is all come up from the earth.A good, industrious farmer will soon have all these things and more than I can describe.Then if a farmer's life is so good, it is a wonder that more of those that live in towns do not make their homes in the country.Surely the world is large enough for every body, and if you cannot get good land at one place you can at another.He that has good land has encouragement.I would not recommend this people to settle on poor ground, like many of the free people in old Virginia and North Carolina, who settled on poor hills that will hardly bring blackberries.There is the state of Illinois, it is a fine country and a free state.And there is the state of Michigan, the finest country likely in America, and many others that I could mention, such as Iowa and Wisconsin.

## CONTEXT: 

And yet the fault might have been in me.   
Few things delighted him more than to be made acquainted with the views of standard evangelical authors on doctrinal subjects.He was at all times particularly interested in clear and sound expositions of such passages of Scripture as are hard to be understood.A friend says,    After I had read to him, at some length, the opinions of one of our ablest divines on a disputed point in theology, he said,    Well, I have long wanted to have that matter explained, but all I could gather about it, was like picking up a few scanty crumbs and dry pieces of crust, which could not satisfy my hunger; but now, you have given me a great loaf, that I may eat and be full at once.       
At another time, on having a very difficult text explained to him, he said,    Whenever I came to that text, I was like a little child two or three years old, trying to go from one room of his father's house into another.After trying again and again to reach and raise the latch, but all in vain, his father comes along, and does, without the least difficulty, what the child could not possibly do.Just so with me. You have opened the door, and now I can go on in.   
He was a close observer of passing events    an accurate discerner of the signs of the times.He looked at every thing in its bearing on the cause of Christ.
 >> He said to us on one occasion,    Real Christians are the salt of the earth; and I do believe that this world would have been destroyed long ago, but for them.

 >> Does not the word of God say, that for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened?   

 >> There were two individuals in the circle of his acquaintance, remarkable, not only for their own destitution of religious principle, but also for doing all they could to suppress it in the large families of which they were the heads.
During their lives, no member of either household made any advance towards forming a connection with the church.Soon after their deaths, which happened nearly about the same time, the widow and several of the children of each, became pious, active members of the church.When his attention was called to this fact, he said,    I have often seen a large, spreading oak, standing alone in a field, with nothing growing under it   but only cut that tree down and take it away, and a little culture will make the land very productive.   
We have already learned that he was admitted to terms of great familiarity with persons of every grade in society; and yet his deportment never savoured of arrogance or presumption.There was but one class of persons with whom he ever used a freedom which the most fastidious could censure.These were such as scoff at sacred and divine subjects.Persons of this sort would sometimes jeer him about his religion; and endeavour to make Christ and his precious cause subjects of buffoonery and ridicule.The old African was far more jealous of his Master's glory than of his own ease or reputation.

## CONTEXT: 

Along in those days I hustled all day and part of the night.I found out it was quite a job to install a plant like this and get it ready by ginning time.The thing that worried me most was that in handling the contractor, as he had been accustomed to working his men on the ten hour system, the sun was two hours high in the morning when they began work, and was two hours high in the evening when they knocked off.As a farmer I could not fit myself gracefully into this system, but I had to take my medicine and do the best I could.However I had my plant ready and was the first man to gin a bale in the county that fall.
This gin was largely advertised, by the different colored farmers all over the country.We had nothing to do but to go ahead ginning.
In a few weeks we were turning out from 25 to 40 bales a day and would often gin until 10 o'clock at night.I expected 800 bales of cotton for the season, but to my surprise we ginned 1,800 bales.This flooded the little town with worlds of money that fall.
 >> Mr. Berry, my competitor, did not gin a bale with me and did not allow any of the hands on his place to gin with me.

 >> Yet this gin had increased his mercantile business 100 per cent above any previous time.

 >> I met him about the close of ginning season and said:    Governor how is your mercantile business?
Is it not a fact that your business has increased 100 per cent as a result of the erection of this plant?   
   I could not say it has increased 100 per cent, but I must say I have done the best business this fall that I have done since I have been merchandising.   
   I am sure you are right because I have paid out all the way from $350 to $500 a day on cotton seed and made the rebate checks in a way that all business men of the town could collect and share alike.   
   Well you are right about that.I must compliment you for what you have done.I have kept you from ginning every bale this fall that I could.If I live to see another year I expect for you to gin every bale of cotton over which I have any influence.I see now that your gin plant is the making of our little town.

## CONTEXT: 

My limbs were yet stiff from the effects of my morning adventure, and to complete my distress, I was totally without provisions, having left a few ears of corn, that I had in my pocket, on the other side of the river.
Leaving my fire in the night, and advancing into the field near me, I discovered a house at some distance and as there was no light, or sign of fire about it, I determined to reconnoitre the premises, which turned out to be a small barn, standing alone, with no other inhabitants about it than a few cattle and a flock of sheep.After much trouble, I succeeded in entering the barn by starting the nails that confined one of the boards at the corner.Entering the house I found it nearly filled with corn, in the husks, and some from which the husks had been removed, was lying in a heap in one corner.
Into these husks I crawled. and covering myself deeply under them, soon became warm, and fell into a profound sleep, from which I was awakened by the noise of people walking about in the barn, and talking of the cattle and sheep, which it appeared they had come to feed, for they soon commenced working in the corn husks, with which I was covered, and throwing them out to the cattle.I expected at every moment that they would uncover me; but fortunately before they saw me, they ceased their operations, and went to work, some husking corn, and throwing the husks on the pile over me, while others were employed in loading the husked corn into carts, as I learned by their conversation, and hauling it away to the house.The people continued working in the barn all day, and in the evening gave more husks to the cattle and went home.
Waiting two or three hours after my visiters were gone, I rose from the pile of husks, and filling my pockets with ears of corn, issued from the barn, at the same place by which I had entered it, and retired to the woods, where I kindled a fire in a pine thicket, and parched more than half a gallon of corn.Before day I returned to the barn, and again secreted myself in the corn husks.In the morning the people again returned to their work, and husked corn until the evening.
 >> At night I again repaired to the woods, and parched more corn.

 >> In this manner I passed more than a month, lying in the barn all day, and going to the woods at night; but at length the corn was all husked, and I watched daily the progress that was made in feeding the cattle with the husks, knowing that I must quit my winter retreat, before the husks were exhausted.

 >> Before the husked corn was removed from the barn, I had conveyed several bushels of the ears into the husks, near my bed, and concealed them for my winter's stock.
Whilst I lay in this barn, there were frequent and great changes of weather.The snow that covered the earth to the depth of two feet, when I came here, did not remain more than ten days, and was succeeded by more than a week of warm rainy weather which was in turn succeeded by several days of dry weather, with cold high winds from the north.The month of February was cloudy and damp, with several squalls of snow and frequent rains.About the first of March, the atmosphere became clear and dry, and the winds boisterous from the west.
On the third of this month, having filled my little bag and all my pockets with parched corn, I quitted my winter quarters about ten o'clock at night, and again proceeded on my way to the north, leaving a large heap of corn husks still lying in the corner of the barn.
On leaving this place, I again pursued the road that had led me to it, for several nights; crossing many small streams in my way, all of which I was able to pass without swimming, though several of them were so deep, that they wet me as high as my arm-pits.This road led nearly northeast, and was the only road that I had fallen in with since I left Georgia, that had maintained that direction for so great a distance.Nothing extraordinary befell me until the twelfth of March, when venturing to turn out earlier than usual in the evening, and proceeding along the road, I found that my way led me down a hill, along the side of which the road had been cut into the earth ten or twelve feet in depth, having steep banks on each side, which were now so damp and slippery, that it was impossible for a man to ascend either the one or the other.

As evening came on, the air became much colder than it was in the forenoon, and after night the wind rose high and blew from the northwest, with intense keenness.My limbs were yet stiff from the effects of my morning adventure, and to complete my distress I was totally without provisions, having left a few ears of corn, that I had in my pocket, on the other side of the river.

## CONTEXT: 

Although I had secured money sufficient to pay for them, according to the agreement made, it seemed inevitable, should I leave them, that some unfeeling white man would obtain it, and they be left to die in slavery, and the effort of a large part of my life spent in vain.Then the thought of my own death would again rush into my mind, and I was overwhelmed in the solemn contemplations of eternity.I tried to pray.    O God,    I cried in my inmost soul,    deliver me from the hands of these wicked men!    At length I observed that those who were carrying me changed their course a little from a direct line to the gallows.A hope, a faint glimmering sprang up within; but then, as they were taking me to the woods, I thought their intention was to murder me there.In such a place they would be less likely to be interrupted than in a spot so exposed as the field upon which the gallows stood.Having conducted me to a little elevation covered with wood, they set me down.
       Now,    said they    we want you to tell us the truth about those abolition lectures you have been giving at the North.   
   I thought I detected in the tone and manner of this demand that they were not quite up to the desperate courage of taking my life.
 >> And yet I replied as if death was in view.

 >> I said that I had related truthfully the circumstances before the court in the morning, and I could only repeat to them what I then said.      

 >> But that was not the truth.
Now tell us the truth!   
   I replied that any different story would be false, and and if I must then die, and whatever they might think I would say in other circumstances, I would not pass into the other world with a lie upon my lips.One of them said,   
      Well, Lunsford, you were always, when you were here, considered a clever fellow, and I did not think you would be engaged in the mean business of making abolition addresses at the North.   
   Several others made similar remarks in a sort of apology for not resorting to extreme measures with me.I replied to them that the people of Raleigh had always maintained that the abolitionists did not believe in expending much money in buying slaves; but contended that their masters should free them without pay.For myself, my simple object was the purchase of my family, and I had labored to do so, without considering the character or the opinions of the persons I approached I had no time to enter into any league with abolitionists, and from my past conduct they certainly could not suppose that I would.After this and other conversation of a like kind, they became tired of questioning me.They at length had a consultation in a low whisper among themselves.

These were soon joined by a brother; and at last, I saw the gentleman himself leave the house, and walk towards the stables, that stood at some distance from the house, on my left.I think even now, that it was a foolish resolution that emboldened me to show myself to this gentleman.It was like throwing one's self in the way of a lion who is known sometimes to spare those whom he might destroy; but I resolved to go and meet this planter at his stables, and tell him my whole story.Issuing from the woods, I crossed the fields unperceived by the people at the house, and going directly to the stables, presented myself to then, proprietor, as he stood looking at a fine horse, in one of the yards.At first, he did not know me, and asked me whose man I was.I then asked him if he did not remember me; and named the time when I had been at his house.I then told at once, that I was a runaway: that my master was dead, and my mistress so cruel, that I could not live with her: not omitting to show the scars on my back, and to give a full account of the manner in which they had been made.The gentleman stood and looked at me more than a minute, without uttering a word, and then said,    Charles, I will not betray you, but you must not stay here.It must not be known that you were on this plantation, and that I saw and conversed with you.However, as I suppose you are hungry, you may go to the kitchen and get your breakfast with my house servants.   

 >> He then set off for the house, and I followed, but turning into the kitchen, as he ordered me, I was soon supplied with a good breakfast of cold meat, warm bread, and as much new butter-milk as I chose to drink.

This injunction I obeyed; and within less than an hour after I entered this truly hospitable house, I quitted it forever, but not without leaving behind me my holiest blessings upon the heads of its inhabitants.It was yet early in the morning when I regained the woods on the opposite side of the plantation, from that by which I had entered it.
CHAPTER XXI.
I could not believe it possible that the white people whom I had just left, would give information of the route I had taken; but as it was possible that all who dwelt on this plantation might not be so pure of heart as were they who possessed it, I thought it prudent to travel some distance in the woods, before I stopped for the day, notwithstanding the risk of moving about in the open light.For the purpose of precluding the possibility of being betrayed, I now determined to quit this road, and travel altogether in the woods, or through open fields, for two or three nights, guiding my march by the stars.In pursuance of this resolution, I bore away to the left of the high road, and travelled five or six miles before I stopped, going round all the fields that I saw in my way, and keeping them at a good distance from me.

## CONTEXT: 

Diversity of opinion may exist in regard to the formation of this union.One may assert, I am a Methodist, another, I am a Baptist, and another, I am a Presbyterian, but different persuasions should not prevent our union,   we should not possess any sectarian feeling or party spirit.UNION should be our constant watchword   it should be the standard to which all of us should rally.As in family relations, so in national affairs,   for example, a man and his wife are at variance, they disagree among themselves, but let any thing arise pertaining to the interest of the whole family, all minor differences and opinions are forthwith forgotten and they become united as one.Let us then, at this important crisis when a matter is pending which is bearing upon our present and eternal destiny, lose sight of all party spirit and sectarian feelings, and unite in one band of love, for, as says the Psalmist,    Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!   
Union must begin among the free, then extend to all.Excuse the remark, I care not where it commence, but it is more in the power of the free to promote it than those who are differently situated, and I verily believe that only a portion of the free should be consulted in the outset   they should be men of worth, good, moral, religious, intelligent, influential men, whose only object would be to promote the glory of God and to do good to their fellow men; with such men at the head, great and wonderful things could be accomplished.Moses, for example, did not go to all the Israelites, but to the elders only when he called the people together.I will state some measures or plan by which the elders could assemble themselves together, and devise some method to effect this great and important object.In order to do this, I would propose that a Convention be held at some time and place, and ministers of all denominations be invited to attend, and adopt some measures to attain this point, which if attained will be instrumental in securing for us peace, happiness and liberty.

 >> It is a common thing for people to suppose that our oppression is occasioned by severe restrictions and disabilities laid upon us by others, but the truth is you keep yourselves down, for as long as you continue to speak evil one of the other and use abusive epithets, and backbite, ridicule and reproach one another with opprobrious names, just so long will you be oppressed, for it is an old and true maxim,    if you do not respect yourself others will not respect you.   

 >> The term Negro originated from a river in Africa called Niger, but it is now used as a term of reproach by both black and white   we must therefore stop it, for unless we do, others will use and apply those terms to us with impunity.

 >> Yea, the great misfortune is that you do not respect yourselves sufficiently; families, societies, religious denominations speak evil one of another, and thereby in a great measure destroy the influeuce which they might otherwise exert.
To sum up all in a few words,    these things ought not so to be.   
Many years have elapsed and no general steps have as yet been taken   it is time we were up and doing.We should shake off our lethargy and make the best use of the means we have.In the first place, parents should by no means neglect the education of their children, but should endeavor to instil such principles in them when young as could never be eradicated by time, place, or circumstance.   You are all aware that impressions can be made upon the mind of the child when young which will be as lasting as time itself, for, says Solomon,    train up a child the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.    Prov. xxii. 6.We should obey God, for obedience, as saith the scripture, is better than sacrifice.

Mr. Gallava was passing my father's when my father met him, and asked him to stop; he said, no, he could not.My father then drew his pistol, and shot him dead.Mr. Gallava's servant came directly to Doct.Steward's and gave the alarm.My father inherited the house and plantation where he lived, from his father, who was a man of considerable notoriety, and I believe, both respected and beloved.His character I cannot give.His name however, has been embalmed by the muses, and lives in song; he being the very person on whom that famous song called    Old Grimes,    was written.The lines are as follows.
TUNE.      John Gilpin was a citizen.   



 >> Old Grimes is dead.   

 >> That good old manWe never shall see more;He us'd to wear a long black coat,All button'd down before.

 >> His heart was open as the day;His feelings all were true;His hair was some inclin'd to gray   He wore it in a queue.
When'eer was heard the voice of pain
His breast with pity burn'd   
The large, round head, upon his cane
From ivory was turn'd.


Thus, ever prompt at pity's call,
He knew no base design   
His eyes were dark, and rather small;
His nose was aquiline.


He liv'd at peace with all mankind,
In friendship he was true;
His coat had pocket-holes behind   
His pantaloons were blue.


Unharm'd   the sin which earth pollutes,
He pass'd securely o'er:
And never wore a pair of boots,
For thirty years, or more.


But poor old Grimes is now at rest,
Nor fears misfortune's frown;
He had a double-breasted vest   
The stripes ran up and down.


He modest merit sought to find,
And pay it its desert:
He had no malice in his mind   
No ruffles on his shirt.


His neighbors he did not abuse,
Was sociable and gay;
He wore large buckles in his shoes,
And chang'd them every day.


His knowledge hid from public gaze,
He did not bring in view   
Nor make a noise town-meeting days,
As many people do.

He died at his own house in J   , about the year 1804.That he suffered his blood to run in the veins of a slave, is the only reflection I would cast upon his memory, which is just none at all in the Slave States.He was a very brave man, I reckon; and when it was attempted to take him, armed his slaves, and would never have been taken alive, if some of his friends had not persuaded him to yield quietly.Mr. Gallava was passing my father's when my father met him, and asked him to stop; he said, no, he could not.My father then drew his pistol and shot him dead.Mr. Gallava's servant came directly to Doctor Steward and gave the alarm.My father inherited the house and plantation where he lived from his father, who was a man of considerable notoriety, and, I believe, both respected and beloved.His character I cannot give.His name, however, has been embalmed by the muses, and lives in song; he being the very person on whom that famous song called, &Old Grimes,& was written.The lines are as follows:

TUNE      John Gilpin was a citizen.   


 >> Old Grimes is dead.   

 >> That good old manWe ne'er shall see him more;He used to wear a long black coat,All button'd down before.

 >> His heart was open as the day;His feelings all were true;His hair was some inclin'd to gray   
He wore it in a queue.


Whene'er was heard the voice of pain
His breast with pity burn'd   
The large, round head upon his cane,
From ivory was turn'd.


Thus, ever prompt at pity's call,
He knew no base design   
His eyes were dark, and rather small;
His nose was aquiline.


He liv'd at peace with all mankind,
In friendship he was true;
His coat had pocket holes behind   
His pantaloons were blue.


Unharm'd   the sin which earth pollutes,
He pass'd securely o'er:
And never wore a pair of boots,
For thirty years or more.


But poor Old Grimes is now at rest,
Nor fears misfortune's frown;
He had a double-breasted vest   
The stripes ran up and down.


He modest merit sought to find,
And pay it its desert:
He had no malice in his mind   
No ruffles on his shirt.

I cannot tell how sad I felt.I said to Mr. Ross,    Can't you go as far as Madeira with the Bishop?   
   No,    he replied,    father says I must go home.   
Then the Bishop said to me,    Well, good bye, Amanda.Take good care of Bob.   
I bade him good-bye the best I could, and left.I never expected to see him again in this life.When I got into the cab, oh! how I cried!And for three days every time I thought of the dear old hero, I had a good cry; I couldn't help it.How good the Lord was to take him to Africa, and bring him back to his home land so well and strong.
 >> How like a God is He who doeth all things well.

 >> Amen.

 >> Again I turn to my story.
Going out at that time gave me fresh cold; I had not got my winter clothes yet; so a dreadful cough set in, and rheumatism in my left arm; and what I suffered, God only knows.But I had quit taking any means.I was willing to trust the Lord.
   Lord,    I said,    there are all the things I have been taking, and they have helped me up to a certain point, and then I had to trust you.So I will trust you and do without taking anything.   
Now this time, the Lord did not seem to test me as before.I just wanted a little relief from pain, for I was going to die anyhow.So I went on.

 >> Then it was some time before he got sick.

   It seems he did get religion, because he was so much changed in his way; but he said he wanted to see his way clearer.

## CONTEXT: 

Daniel no sooner appeared among the people of his slaughtered father, than old disagreements revived, civil war broke out, the enlightened African was defeated, barely escaping from the scene of * PUNCH, seeing a joke, and availing himself of it, said lately:           Ira est furor brevis.     The theatrical critics are loud in praise of a real Ethiopian tragredian, Mr. Aldridge, with the unusual christian name of Ira, which is no doubt symbolical of its owner being    the rage    wherever he goes.    strife with his life, and for some time unable to quit the country, which was watched by numerous enemies, anxious for his capture.Nine years elapsed before the proscribed family escaped to America, during the whole of which time they were concealed in the neighbourhood of their foes, enduring vicissitudes and hardships that can well be imagined not be described.
On their arrival in America, Daniel returned to his ministerial duties, influencing aright the minds of people of his own complexion in that country instead of his own.He did not live in vain, as the following extract from the obituary of an American paper at the time of his decease in 1840, may testify:      There are few individuals who have been more generally useful than the Rev. Mr. Aldridge, and whose loss will be more severely felt in New York, among his coloured brethren, to whom he was endeared by his faithful discharge of the duties incumbent on him as a Christian minister.   
Ira Aldridge was born soon after his father's arrival in Senegal, and on their return to America, was intended by the latter for the church.Many a white parent has    chalked out    in vain for his son a similar calling, and the best intentions have been thwarted by an early predilection quite in an opposite direction.We can well account for the father's choice in this instance, as in keeping with his own aspirations; and we can easily imagine his disappointment upon abandoning all hope of seeing one of his blood and colour following specially in the service of his great Master.The son, however, began betimes to shew his early preference and ultimate passion.
 >> At school he was awarded prizes for declamation, in which he excelled; and there his curiosity was excited by what he heard of theatrical representations, which he was told embodied all the fine ideas shadowed forth in the language he read and committed to memory.

 >> It became the wish of his heart to witness one of these performances, and that wish he soon contrived to gratify, and finally he became a candidate for histrionic fame.

 >> Notwithstanding the progress Ira had made in learning, no qualities of the mind could compensate in the eyes of the Americans, for the dark hue of his skin.
The prevailing prejudice, so strong among all classes, was against him.This induced his removal to England, where he entered at the Glasgow University, and, under Professor Sandford, obtained several premiums, and the medal for Latin composition.Space does not admit of our following his career.His early preference    grew with his growth and strengthened with his strength,    and despite his one personal disadvantage, he has obtained a reputation which stamps his abilities as a tragic and comic actor beyond dispute.He is allowed to possess every mental and physical requisite for those parts he performs.He has a clear and flexible voice, which he uses with great judgment and taste; he can infuse great expression and feeling into his intonation; his emphasis is judicious, and his transitions natural and appropriate.Sheridan Knowles complimented and encouraged him; and Edmund Kean, in a letter of recommendation, says,    I have witnessed his performances with pleasure: he possesses wonderful versatility.    Madame Malibran, in speaking of his personation of Othello, said she    never witnessed, in the course of her professional career in both hemispheres, a more interesting and powerful performance, marked throughout by that strict adherence to nature which should be the characteristic of every dramatic portraiture.

With this understanding, the Rev. Silax X. Floyd was unanimously elected as Pastor of the Tabernacle Baptist Church, and installed as Pastor on Tuesday night, Sept. 26, 1899.
The following account of Dr. Walker's last Sunday night with his Augusta church is taken from the Augusta (Ga.) Chronicle of Sept. 25, 1899:
   Last night Dr. C. T. Walker preached his farewell sermon at Tabernacle Baptist Church.The church was packed to overflowing.A Chronicle reporter called soon after the service commenced, and found great crowds going away, unable to gain admission.
   The service commenced by singing,    Come, ye disconsolate,    the hymn being read by the Rev. Silas X. Floyd, A. M., pastor-elect of Tabernacle Church.Prayer was offered by Bishop R. S. Williams, of the C. M. E. Church.
   Dr. Walker used for a text Acts 20:32,    And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.   
   In his opening remarks, the speaker referred to the fact that in the 20th chapter of Acts the apostle Paul was delivering his farewell message to the elders of Ephesus.Concerning himself, the apostle had been desirous all along of two things.One was that he might be faithful, and the other was that he might finish well.
 >> The apostle commended the Ephesians to God   to God's providence, to God's protection, to God's word.

 >> He commended them in this way for their edification and for their glorification.   

 >> Then leaving the text, he delivered some very pathetic and helpful parting words to his congregation.
Among other things he urged them to be a united people; he plead with them to stand together and to uphold the hands of the young man who had been called to succeed him; he urged them to be industrious, progressive, self-respecting and self-reliant; with much eloquence he called upon them to be interested in all the affairs of their race   he appealed to them to be law-abiding and to make themselves a credit to the race and to the city of Augusta and not a disgrace.
   Parting words were also spoken to the officers of the church.Parting thanks were expressed to the church, to the sinners, to the citizens, white and colored, who had stood by him and made his success possible.
   In closing he gave a brief summary of his 14 years work in this city.During that time he has baptized at his church over 1,400 people erected a handsome brick church, bought an    Old Folks' Home,    the church and home valued at over $20,000, and done many other things of which he did not speak.Many of the congregation were shedding tears at the close of the service.The parting hymn was    God be with you till we meet again.       
The Mount Olivet Baptist Church was organized March 10, 1878.

## CONTEXT: 

There was a number of boys on board, which still made it more agreeable; for we were always together, and a great part of our time was spent in play.I remained in this ship a considerable time, during which we made several cruises, and visited a variety of places: among others we were twice in Holland, and brought over several persons of distinction from it, whose names I do not now remember.On the passage, one day, for the diversion of those gentlemen, all the boys were called on the quarter-deck, and were paired proportionably, and then made to fight; after which the gentleman gave the combatants from five to nine shillings each.This was the first time I ever fought with a white boy; and I never knew what it was to have a bloody nose before.This made me fight most desperately; I suppose considerably more than an hour: and at last, both of us being weary, we were parted.I had a great deal of this kind of sport afterwards, in which the captain and the ship's company used very much to encourage me.Sometime afterwards the ship went to Leith in Scotland, and from thence to the Orkneys, where I was surprised in seeing scarcely any night: and from thence we sailed with a great fleet, full of soldiers, for England.All this time we had never come to an engagement, though we were frequently cruising off the coast of France: during which we chased many vessels, and took in all seventeen prizes.I had been learning many of the man  uvres of the ship during our cruise; and I was several times made to fire the guns.One evening, off Havre de Grace, just as it was growing dark, we were standing off shore, and met with a fine large French-built frigate.
 >> We got all things immediately ready for fighting; and I now expected I should be gratified in seeing an engagement, which I had so long wished for in vain.

 >> But the very moment the word of command was given to fire we heard those on board the other ship    Haul down the jib;    and in that instant she hoisted English colours.

 >> There was instantly with us an amazing cry of   Avast! or stop firing; and I think one or two guns had been let off, but happily they did no mischief.
We had hailed them several times; but they not hearing, we received no answer, which was the cause of our firing.The boat was then sent on board of her, and she proved to be the Ambuscade man of war, to my no small disappointment.We returned to Portsmouth, without having been in any action, just at the trial of Admiral Byng (whom I saw several times during it): and my master having left the ship, and gone to London for promotion, Dick and I were put on board the Savage sloop of war, and we went in her to assist in bringing off the St. George man of war, that had ran ashore somewhere on the coast.After staying, a few weeks on board the Savage, Dick and I were sent on shore at Deal, where we remained some short time, till my master sent for us to London, the place I had long desired exceedingly to see.We therefore both with great pleasure got into a waggon, and came to London, where we were received by a Mr. Guerin, a relation of my master.This gentleman had two sisters, very amiable ladies, who took much notice and great care of me.Though I had desired so much to see London, when I arrived in it I was unfortunately unable to gratify my curiosity; for I had at this time the chilblains to such a degree that I could not stand for several months, and I was obliged to be sent to St. George's Hospital.There I grew so ill, that the doctors wanted to cut my left leg off a different times, apprehending a mortification; but I always said I would rather die than suffer it; and happily (I thank God) I recovered without the operation.

## CONTEXT: 

People of the northern states, who make excursions to the south, visit the principal cities and towns, travel the most frequented highways, or even sojourn for a time at the residences of the large planters, and partake of their hospitality and amusements, know nothing of the condition of the southern slaves.To acquire this knowledge, the traveller must take up his abode for a season, in the lodge of the overseer, pass a summer in the remote cotton fields, or spend a year within view of the rice swamps.By attending for one month, the court which the overseer of a large estate holds every evening in the cotton-gin yard, and witnessing the execution of his decrees, a Turk or a Russian would find the tribunals of his country far outdone.
It seems to be a law of nature, that slavery is equally destructive to the master and the slave; for, whilst it stupifies the latter with fear, and reduces him below the condition of man, it brutalizes the former, by the practice of continual tyranny; and makes him the prey of all the vices which render human nature loathsome.
In the following simple narrative of an unlearned man, I have endeavoured, faithfully and truly, to present to the reader, some of the most material accidents which occurred to myself, in a period of thirty years of slavery in the free Republic of the United States; as well as many circumstances, which I observed in the condition and conduct of other persons during that period.
It has been supposed, by many, that the state of the southern slaves is constantly becoming better; and that the treatment which they receive at the hands of their masters, is progressively milder and more humane; but the contrary of all this is unquestionably the truth; for, under the bad culture which is practised in the south, the land is constantly becoming poorer, and the means of getting food, more and more difficult.So long as the land is new and rich, and produces corn and sweet potatoes abundantly, the black people seldom suffer greatly for food; but, when the ground is all cleared, and planted in rice or cotton, corn and potatoes become scarce; and when corn has to be bought on a cotton plantation, the people must expect to make acquaintance with hunger.
My grandfather was brought from Africa, and sold as a slave in Calvert county, in Maryland, about the year 1730.I never understood the name of the ship in which he was imported, nor the name of the planter who bought him on his arrival, but at the time I knew him, he was a slave in a family called Mauel, who resided near Leonardtown.My father was a slave in a family named Hantz, living near the same place.
 >> My mother was the slave of a tobacco planter, an old man, who died, according to the best of my recollection, when I was about four years old, leaving his property in such a situation that it became necessary, as I suppose, to sell a part of it to pay his debts.

 >> Soon after his death, several of his slaves, and with others myself, were sold at public vendue.

 >> My mother had several children, my brothers and sisters, and we were all sold on the same day to different purchasers.
Our new master took us away, and I never saw my mother, nor any of my brothers and sisters afterwards.This was, I presume, about the year 1785. I learned subsequently, from my father, that my mother was sold to a Georgia trader, who soon after that carried her away from Maryland.Her other children were sold to slave-dealers from Carolina, and were also taken away, so that I was left alone in Calvert county, with my father, whose owner lived only a few miles from my new master's residence.At the time I was sold I was quite naked, having never had any clothes in my life; but my new master had brought with him a child's frock or wrapper, belonging to one of his own children; and after he had purchased me, he dressed me in this garment, took me before him on his horse, and started home; but my poor mother, when she saw me leaving her for the last time, ran after me, took me down from the horse, clasped me in her arms, and wept loudly and bitterly over me.My master seemed to pity her, and endeavoured to soothe her distress by telling her that he would be a good master to me, and that I should not want any thing.She then, still holding me in her arms, walked along the road beside the horse as he moved slowly, and earnestly and imploringly besought my master to buy her and the rest of her children, and not permit them to be carried away by the negro buyers; but whilst thus entreating him to save her and her family, the slave-driver, who had first bought her, came running in pursuit of her with a raw hide in his hand.When he overtook us he told her he was her master now, and ordered her to give that little negro to its owner, and come back with him.
My mother then turned to him and cried,

## CONTEXT: 

Having perceived the country in which I now was to be thickly peopled, I remained in my resting place until late at night, when returning to the road and crossing, it, I took once more to the woods, with the stars for my guides, and steered for the northeast.
This was a fortunate night for me in all respects.The atmosphere was clear, the ground was high, dry, and free from thickets.In the course of the night I passed several corn fields, with the corn still remaining in them, and passed a potato lot, in which large quantities of fine potatoes were dug out of the ground and lay in heaps covered with vines; but my most signal good luck occurred just before day, when passing under a dog-wood tree, and hearing a noise in the branches above me, I looked up and saw a large opossum amongst the berries that hung, upon the boughs.The game was quickly shaken down, and turned out as fat as a well-fed pig, and as heavy as a full-grown raccoon.My attention was now turned to searching for a place in which I could secrete myself for the day, and dress my provisions in quietness.
This day was clear and beautiful until the afternoon, when the air became damp, and the heavens were overhung with clouds.The night that followed was dark as pitch, compelling me to remain in my camp all night.The next clay brought with it a terrible storm of rain and wind, that continued with but little intermission, more than twenty-four hours, and the sun was not again visible until the third day; nor was there a clear night for more than a week.During all this time I lay in my camp, and subsisted upon the provisions that I had brought with me to this place.
 >> The corn and potatoes looked so tempting, when I saw them in the fields, that I had taken more than I should have consumed, had not the bad weather compelled me to remain at this spot; but it was well for me, for this time, that I had taken more than I could eat in one or two days.

 >> At the end of the cloudy weather, I felt much refreshed and strengthened, and resumed my journey in high spirits, although I now began to feel the want of shoes - those which I wore when I left my mistress having long since been worn out, and my boots were wrap straps of hickory bark about my feet to keep the leather from separating, and falling to pieces.

 >> It was now, by my computation, the month of November, and I was yet in the State of South Carolina.
I began to consider with myself, whether I had gained or lost, by attempting, to travel on the roads; and, after revolving in my mind all the disasters that had befallen me, determined to abandon the roads altogether, for two reasons: the first of which was, that on the highways I was constantly liable to meet persons, or to be overtaken by them; and a second, no less powerful, was, that as I did not know what roads to pursue, I was oftener traveling on the wrong route than on the right one.
Setting my face once more for the north-star, I advanced with a steady, though slow pace, for four or five nights, when I was again delayed by dark weather, and forced to remain in idleness nearly two weeks; and when the weather again became clear, I was arrested on the second night by a broad and rapid river, that appeared so formidable that I did not dare to attempt its passage until after examining it in daylight.On the succeeding night, however, I crossed it by swimming - resting at some large rocks near the middle.After gaining the north side of this river, which I believed to be the Catawba, I considered myself in North Carolina, and again steered towards the North.
CHAPTER XVIII.
THE month of November is, in all years, a season of clouds and vapors; but at the time of which I write, the good weather vanished early in the month, and all the clouds of the universe seemed to have collected in North Carolina.From the second night after crossing the Catawba, I did not see the north-star for the space of three weeks; and during all this time, no progress was made in my journey; although I seldom remained two days in the same place, but moved from one position to another, for the purpose of eluding the observation of the people of the country, whose attention might have been attracted by the continual appearance of the smoke of my fires in one place.
There had, as yet, been no hard frost, and the leaves were still on the oak trees, at the close of this cloudy weather; but the northwest wind which dispelled the mist, also brought down nearly all the leaves of the forest, except those of the evergreen trees; and the nights now became clear, and the air keen with frost.

Our own conviction is that until the Negro knows and is convinced in head and heart that God has not sent him into the world as a mere toy to be kicked about by every and any one   until he learns that fate has not made him to be a mere spectator and serf    we can never hope for better things to befall our people.Our aim in this book is not merely to give an account of one of our own kind, or to turn the light of this closing century upon slavery, but to put into the hands of the rising generation the history of one who has, by sheer force of character, raised himself above the degrading condition of the life in which he was born.
By following Walter Hawkins from a slave farm to a Bishopric, we shall see how Providence has provided every man with the means   if he will use them   to improve his position in the world; the young Negro will see that while he may not become a bishop, doctor, or lawyer, he may so utilise his opportunities that he shall command respect from those who have hitherto regarded all Negroes as vagrants, destined to wander on the face of the earth.The race will feel that, with patience, perseverance, and hard work, what Bishop Hawkins has done in one direction, millions may do in other ways.Ah!we trust that his life will urge the race not to look to others so much as to themselves.I confess my inability to do justice to the subject, as I have had no experience in this kind of work; and, secondly, I have had little time to give to its preparation, as I have to work for my living while prosecuting my studies.I have tried to give an historical sketch of slavery from its introduction in the New World down to the time of Bishop Hawkins.I have also tried to give an historical sketch of several places where he stopped before he finally settled in Canada, as I thought it would add to the interest of the life of one who has served his race   and through them humanity   in a way I should like to serve them.
I must thank my many friends for their advice and suggestions.
 >> I do hope, most sincerely, that no one will blame Bishop Hawkins for any statement which they might think ought to have been left out.

 >> Perhaps a little more polish would have made me choose better words to express myself; still I will trust to the generosity of the impartial reader to exonerate me from any wilful desire to wound the susceptibility of the race who are, for the most part, responsible for our shortcomings.

INTRODUCTION.
NO race under heaven (except, perhaps, the Jewish nation) have suffered so many wrongs, endured more insults, and survived so many centuries of private and public vicissitudes as the African race.Many of the nations who afflicted the African are no more; yet, at this day, the nations who glory in the knowledge of their being members of the Aryan family, or some other real or imaginary race, take a pride in perpetually reminding the Negro of the inferiority of his kind: that he is a savage, or at least a child, who does not improve in intelligence, though he develops in body.Every nation of antiquity have had something to say in praise or blame of the Negro, and most, if not all, have had something to do with him.By all, ancient and modern, he has been robbed, murdered and enslaved; his daughter has been robbed of her virtue before his eyes; his home broken, and his country pillaged and laid waste.It is as yesterday that the nations of the West began to think seriously either of his country or the Negro, or both; but none of the ancients ever afflicted the man as the moderns have done.Not content with setting tribe against tribe in Africa, they tore him away from the bosom of his country; packed him in ships, chained as though he were a murderer, and sold him.They were not content with these methods of degrading him, but every moral, mental and religious influence was kept from him   for centuries   save such as would tend to make him more docile to his master.

In some one of your letters which I do not recollect   you speak (with honest indignation) of the treachery and chicanery of the Natives*.* Extracts of two letters from Mr. W   e to his Father, dated Bombay, 1776 and 1777.   1776.I have introduced myself to Mr. G   , who behaved very friendly in giving me some advice, which was very necessary, as the inhabitants, who are chiefly Blacks, are a set of canting, deceitful people, and of whom one must have great caution.      1777.I am now thoroughly convinced, that the account which Mr. G   gave me of the natives of this country is just and true, that they are a set of deceitful people, and have not such a word as Gratitude in their language, neither do they know what it is   and as to their dealings in trade, they are like unto Jews.      My good friend, you should remember from whom they learnt those vices:   the first christian visitors found them a simple, harmless people   but the cursed avidity for wealth urged these first visitors (and all the succeeding ones) to such acts of deception   and even wanton cruelty   that the poor ignorant Natives soon learnt to turn the knavish   land diabolical arts which they too soon imbibed   upon their teachers.

 >> I am sorry to observe that the practice of your country (which as a resident I love   and for its freedom   and for the many blessings I enjoy in it   shall ever have my warmest wishes   prayers   and blessings); I say it is with reluctance, that I must observe your country's conduct has been uniformly wicked in the East   West-Indies   and even on the coast of Guinea.   

 >> The grand object of English navigators   indeed of all christian navigators   is money   money   money   for which I do not pretend to blame them   Commerce was meant by the goodness of the Deity to diffuse the various goods of the earth into every part   to unite mankind in the blessed chains of brotherly love   society   and mutual dependence:   the enlightened Christian should diffuse the riches of the Gospel of peace   with the commodities of his respective land   Commerce attended with strict honesty   and with Religion for its companion   would be a blessing to every shore it touched at.   

 >> In Africa, the poor wretched natives   blessed with the most fertile and luxuriant soil   are rendered so much the more miserable for what Providence meant as a blessing:   the Christians' abominable traffic for slaves   and the horrid cruelty and treachery of the petty Kings   encouraged by their Christian customers   who carry them strong liquors   to enflame their national madness   and powder   and bad fire-arms   to furnish them with the hellish means of killing and kidnapping.   
But enough   it is a subject that fours my blood   and I am sure will not please the friendly bent of your social affections.   I mentioned these only to guard my friend against being too hasty in condemning the knavery of a people who bad as they may be   possibly   were made worse   by their Christian visitors.   Make human nature thy study   wherever thou residest   whatever the religion   or the complexion   study their hearts.   Simplicity, kindness, and charity be thy guide   with these even Savages will respect you   and God will bless you!
Your father   who sees every improvement of his boy with delight   observes that your hand-writing is much for the better   in truth, I think it as well as any modest man can wish:   if my long epistles do not frighten you   and I live till the return of next spring   perhaps I shall be enabled to judge how much you are improved since your last favour:   write me a deal about the natives   the soil and produce   the domestic and interior manners of the people   customs   prejudices   fashons   and follies.   Alas!we have plenty of the two last here   and what is worse, we have politics   and a detestable Brother's war   where the right hand is hacking and hewing the left   whilst Angels weep at our madness   and Devils rejoice at the ruinous prospect.
Mr. R    and the ladies are well.

So we concealed ourselves, in sight of this plantation until about bed time, when we saw the lights extinguished.
During the day we saw a female slave passing from the dwelling house to the kitchen as if she was the cook; the house being about three rods from the landlord's dwelling.After we supposed the whites were all asleep, Jack slipped up softly to the kitchen to try his luck with the cook, to see if he could get any thing from her to eat.
I would remark that the domestic slaves are often found to be traitors to their own people, for the purpose of gaining favor with their masters; and they are encouraged and trained up by them to report every plot they know of being formed about stealing any thing, or running away, or any thing of the kind; and for which they are paid.This is one of the principal causes of the slaves being divided among themselves, and without which they could not be held in bondage one year, and perhaps not half that time.
I now proceed to describe the unsuccessful attempt of poor Jack to obtain something from the female slave to satisfy hunger.The planter's house was situated on an elevated spot on the side of a hill.The fencing about the house and garden was very crookedly laid up with rails.The night was rather dark and rainy, and Jack left me with the understanding that I was to stay at a certain place until he returned.I cautioned him before he left me to be very careful   and after he started, I left the place where he was going to find me when he returned, for fear something might happen which might lead to my detection, should I remain at that spot.
 >> So I left it and went off where I could see the house, and that place too.

 >> Jack had not long been gone, before I heard a great noise; a man, crying out with a loud voice,    Catch him!

 >> Catch him!    and hissing the dogs on, and
they were close after Jack.The next thing I saw, was Jack running for life, and an old white man after him, with a gun, and his dogs.The fence being on sidling ground, and wet with the rain, when Jack run against it he knocked down several pannels of it and fell, tumbling over and over to the foot of the hill; but soon recovered and ran to where he had left me; but I was gone.The dogs were still after him.
There happened to be quite a thicket of small oak shrubs and bushes in the direction he ran.I think he might have been heard running and straddling bushes a quarter of a mile!The poor fellow hurt himself considerably in straddling over bushes in that way, in making his escape.
Finally the dogs relaxed their chase and poor Jack and myself again met in the thick forest.

CHAPTER V.
THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE.
Before starting for Tuskegee I found it almost impossible to find the town on any map, and had difficulty in learning its exact location.I reached Tuskegee about the middle of June, 1881 I found it to be a town of some 2,000 inhabitants, about half of whom were Negroes, and located in what is commonly called the    Black Belt,    that is, the section of the South where the Negro race largely outnumbers the white population.The county in which Tuskegee is located is named Macon.Of Tuskegee and Macon County I prefer to quote the words of Maj.W. W. Screws, the editor of the    Montgomery (Alabama) Daily Advertiser,    who visited Tuskegee in 1898, seventeen years after the Tuskegee Institute was founded.Maj.Screws says:
   Just at this time there is probably no place in the United States, of similar size, so well known to the people of the country, as this lovely little city.It has always possessed merits which brought it conspicuously before Alabamians, for in every locality in this and many Southern States are noble men and women who received their educational training here.
   
 >> Thomas S. Woodward was one of the earliest white settlers in Macon County, and was one of the commissioners appointed to lay off the site for the court house.

 >> He built the first house in the new town, which they called Tuskegee, a corruption of the old Indian name, Tuskigi, which is said by Dr. Gatschet to be a contraction of Taskialgi (warriors).

 >> The old Indian town stood in the fork of the Coosa and was the home, part of the time, of the famous half-breed statesman, Alexander McGillivray.
The name passed in its present form to the county seat of the new county.
   Tuskegee was settled by men who were well to do in a material point of view.They owned rich lands on the creeks and streams and in the prairie section of the county.This point is on a high, dry ridge, and from time immemorial has been noted for its healthfulness.Here came those who wished to build homes for their families, to have congenial company and to give their children educational advantages.They did not desire the projectors of the Montgomery and West Point, Railroad to put the town on its route, because of the interruption it was feared would be occasioned to the schools.From the very beginning of its existence, education has been the main feature of Tuskegee, and through its schools and colleges a population gathered here which has never been excelled in point of refinement, politeness and all the gentle amenities which tend to make life comfortable.
   The town of Tuskegee was first settled about 1830.

With peace and liberty for ever blest,

TO MR.MOSES ROPER.
VERSES WRITTEN IMPROMPTU BY A MAN OF COLOUR, ON MEETING MR.ROPER IN THE VALE OF LEVEN, DUMBARTONSHIRE.


Sweet Leven! sung in classic style of yore
By Smollett, in such warm impassioned strain,
I love upon thy flowing stream to pore.
And hail, fair Freedom, thy delightful reign.



 >> Thank Heaven, I have lived to see begun,And consummated nearly, I may say,The glorious work of Liberty,   whose sunHas usher'd in the smile of risen day.

 >> And, Caledonia, much I love thy strand,

 >> First in the list of freedom's friends thou art;My warmest praise thou ever wilt command,And I shall, Scotia, bear thee near my heart.
But oh! my country! must thou still remain
To wear thy fetters   and degraded be?
When shall be torn the galling cruel chain?
Must thou be doom'd to endless slavery?


No! thou art class'd already among the free   
See thy warm advocate, young Roper, stand!
In love's sweet embassy most powerfully
He breaks thy chain, with mighty giant hand.


His tyrant follows with his bloody hounds,
The track is lost   he plunges in the wave;
And now with fleetest speed onward he bounds,
And from him throws the cursed brand of slave.


Heaven throws its shield around thee, gallant youth,
With open arms, lo!

These few words an hour or two before, would have saved Harriet her whippings for that day, as they probably did for many a day after.
While with this woman, after working from early morning till late at night, she was obliged to sit up all night to rock a cross, sick child.Her mistress laid upon her bed with a whip under her pillow, and slept; but if the tired nurse forgot herself for a moment, if her weary head dropped, and her hand ceased to rock the cradle, the child would cry out, and then down would come the whip upon the neck and face of the poor weary creature.The scars are still plainly visible where the whip cut into the flesh.Perhaps her mistress was preparing her, though she did not know it then, by this enforced habit of wakefulness, for the many long nights of travel, when she was the leader and guide of the weary and hunted ones who were escaping from bondage.
   Miss Susan    got tired of Harriet, as Harriet was determined she should do, and so abandoned intention of buying her, and sent her back to her master.She was next hired out to the man who inflicted upon her the lifelong injury from which she is suffering now, by breaking her skull with a weight from the scales.The injury thus inflicted causes her often to fall into a state of somnolency from which it is almost impossible to rouse her.Disabled and sick, her flesh all wasted away, she was returned to her owner.He tried to sell her, but no one would buy her.    
 >> Dey said dey wouldn't give a sixpence for me,    she said.   

 >> And so,    she said,    from Christmas till March I worked as I could, and I prayed through all the long nights   I groaned and prayed for ole master:    Oh Lord, convert master!       

 >> Oh Lord, change dat man's heart!    'Pears like I prayed all de time,    said Harriet;     'bout my work, everywhere, I prayed an' I groaned to de Lord.
When I went to de horse-trough to wash my face, I took up de water in my han' an' I said,    Oh Lord, wash me, make me clean!    Den I take up something to wipe my face, an' I say,    Oh Lord, wipe away all my sin!    When I took de broom and began to sweep, I groaned,    Oh Lord, wha'soebber sin dere be in my heart, sweep it out, Lord, clar an' clean!       No words can describe the pathos of her tones, as she broke out into these words of prayer, after the manner of her people.    An' so,    said she,    I prayed all night long for master, till the first of March; an' all the time he was bringing people to look at me, an' trying to sell me.Den we heard dat some of us was gwine to be sole to go wid de chain-gang down to de cotton an' rice fields, and dey said I was gwine, an' my brudders, an' sisters.Den I changed my prayer.Fust of March I began to pray,    Oh Lord, if you ant nebber gwine to change dat man's heart, kill him, Lord, an' take him out ob de way.

Aside from her studies at Tuskegee, she has already begun to teach there.
Booker Taliaferro is my next oldest child.Young as he is, he has already nearly mastered the brickmason's trade.He began working at this trade when he was quite small, dividing his time between this and class work; and he has developed great skill in the trade and a fondness for it.He says that he is going to be an architect and brickmason.One of the most satisfactory letters that I have ever received from any one came to me from Booker, last summer.When I left home for the summer, I told him that he must work at his trade half of each day, and that the other half of the day he could spend as he pleased.When I had been away from home two weeks, I received the following letter from him:
TUSKEGEE, ALABAMA.
MY DEAR PAPA:Before you left home you told me to work at my trade half of each day.
 >> I like my work so much that I want to work at my trade all day.

 >> Besides, I want to earn all the money I can, so that when I go to another school I shall have money to pay my expenses.

 >> Your son,BOOKER.
My youngest child, Ernest Davidson Washington, says that he is going to be a physician.In addition to going to school, where he studies books and has manual training, he regularly spends a portion of his time in the office of our resident physician, and has already learned to do many of the duties which pertain to a doctor's office.
The thing in my life which brings me the keenest regret is that my work in connection with public affairs keeps me for so much of the time away from my family, where, of all places in the world, I delight to be.I always envy the individual whose life-work is so laid that he can spend his evenings at home.I have sometimes thought that people who have this rare privilege do not appreciate it as they should.It is such a rest and relief to get away from crowds of people, and handshaking, and travelling, and get home, even if it be for but a very brief while.
Another thing at Tuskegee out of which I get a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction is in the meeting with our students, and teachers, and their families in the chapel for devotional exercises every evening at half-past eight, the last thing before retiring for the night.It is an inspiring sight when one stands on the platform there and sees before him eleven or twelve hundred earnest young men and women; and one cannot but feel that it is a privilege to help to guide them to a higher and more useful life.

And they eat, and eat, and drink, to their satisfaction.The supper being over, with the moon shining brightly (moon-light nights were invariably selected for corn-shuckings) the boys spend some time in wrestling, foot racing and jumping before going home.And in all these games they matched one's agility, strength, and manhood against that of his fellow.This is kept up until a late hour of the night, and then they retire to the various plantations whither they belong.
Such was the corn-shucking on the old plantation in ante-bellum days.It was very much enjoyed by both the white folks and the slaves.The incidents and the happenings of a corn-shucking were long talked of on all the plantations represented.Nearly all the plantations had their corn-shuckings, and they certainly kept things lively during this season of the year in those days.

So this little life of mine has been almost locked up in a nutshell, and Jesus has come to me in the spirit's power that I should tell the world of His wonderful love to me a poor sinner of the dust.And what can not the Lord do for those who put their trust in Him?We feel like saying to the blessed One, how amiable are all of Thy works, oh Lord, and our eyes are seeing Thy salvation in many parts of the earth.
I can remember the first time that it was my pleasure to hear dear Dr. J. D. Fulton.It was on Thanksgiving Day when he first came to this city to preach at the Hanson Place Church, as their pastor.The Rev. David Moore had him to preach the Thanksgiving sermon at the Washington Avenue Baptist Church, and we were all delighted at hearing him on that day.I loved him on hearing that sermon, for I felt the spirit power on that day, through his preaching.I shall always think of the Doctor and his loving family, for we, as the negro race, have not such a friend on earth as Dr. Fulton.I am not afraid to say it to his dear honor is he is not dead, and I wish every negro knew him as I do for then they would all feel toward him as I feel.I hope that he will long live to tell the truth as he has in days gone by; and if he was in this city where the evil is so strong, we should hear him sounding the watchword, and that is the reason that those that loved the ways of sin did not like him, for they felt that he had cause to trouble them while they were yet in their sins.

 >> But I hope that the day will come when.

 >> I shall hear him again in this city, and I hope that God will give him long life and that he may see the travel of his soul and be satisfied, for, I know that he tries to do God's will in this love that he has for humanity and that is why the Lord will bless him in all the work that his hands find to do.

 >> I was not at home when he left this city and I felt sad when I found that he was gone, for we shall ever miss him.
My prayer is to God that he may live to a good old age and that when he shall be called to come up higher that he may be caught up in the air to meet his Lord and Master and all of those that have gone on before, and be ready to Crown Him King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
PROGRESS OF CHURCH WORK.
A speech to a crowded church, in the year of our Lord 1888, in Talcott, Summers Co., W. V. I was asked to have this published out there, but I wanted to have it brought to my home in Brooklyn.I was into so much work out there, and my people were not there to see what the Lord did help me to do:
Dear friends, we are here to-night to commemorate this grand occasion, and our watchword is Onward and Upward to the Prize!
This is a time that we should all shout the Jubilee and to send the glad tidings to all the world and to let all the nations know that we are on our march to that happy land of song.
Dear friends, let us look for a few moments and think of the time when you had not a church where you could worship God.I told you that God would give you this lovely place, where no one could drive you out, and to see what great things He has done for you in a little time, and how great things can He not do if we will only trust Him? We have those of our race that have held places of greatest trust and God bless them in those places.Why should we give up the fight and lay our armor by when there is so much for us to do?

A William and an Ellen Craft, indeed performed an almost equally hazardous undertaking, and one which, as a devoted admirer of human daring has said, far exceeded any thing recorded by Macaulay, and will yet be made the ground-work for a future Scott to build a more intensely interesting tale upon than    the author of Waverly    ever put forth, but they had the benefit of their eyes and ears   they were not entirely helpless; enclosed in a moving tomb, and as utterly destitute of power to control your movements as if death had fastened its icy arm upon you, and yet possessing all the full tide of gushing sensibilities, and a complete knowledge of your existence, as was the case with our friend.We read with horror of the burial of persons before life has entirely fled from them, but here is a man who voluntarily assumed a condition in which he well knew all the chances were against him, and when his head seemed well-nigh severed from his body, on account of the concussion occasioned by the rough handling to which he was subject, see the Spartan firmness of his soul.Not a groan escaped from his agonized heart, as the realities of his condition were so vividly presented before him.Death stared him in the face, but like Patrick Henry, only when the alternative was more a matter of fact than it was to that patriot, he exclaims,    Give me liberty or give me death;    and death seemed to say, as quickly as the lion seizes the kid cast into its den,    You are already mine,    and was about to wrap its sable mantle around the form of our self-martyred hero   bound fast upon the altars of freedom, as the Hindoo widow is bound upon the altar of a husband's love; when the bright angel of liberty, whose dazzling form he had so long and so anxiously watched, as he pored over the scheme hid in the recesses of his own fearless brain, while yet a slave, and whose shining eyes had bewitched his soul, until he had said in the language of one of old to Jesus,    I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest;    when this blessed goddess stood at his side, and, as Jesus said to one lying cold in death's embrace,    I say unto thee, arise,    said to him, as she took him by the hand and lifted him from his travelling tomb,    thy warfare is over, thy work is accomplished, a free man art thou, my guidance has availed thee, arise and breathe the air of freedom.   
Did Lazarus astonish his weeping sisters, and the surrounding multitude, as he emerged from his house of clay, clad in the habiliments of the grave, and did joy unfeigned spread throughout that gazing throng?
 >> How much more astonishing seemed the birth of Mr. Brown, as he    came forth    from a box, clothed not in the habiliments of the grave, but in those of slavery, worse than the    silent house of death,    as his acts had testified; and what greater joy thrilled through the wondering witnesses, as the lid was removed from the travelling carriage of our friend's electing, and straightway arose therefrom a living man, a being made in God's own image, a son of Jehovah, whom the piety and republicanism of this nation had doomed to pass through this terrible ordeal, before the wand of the goddess of liberty could complete his transformation from a slave to a free man!

 >> But we will desist from further comments.

 >> Here is the plain narrative of our friend, and is it asking too much of you, whose sympathies may be aroused by the recital which follows, to continue to peruse these pages until the cause of all his sufferings is depicted before you, and your duty under the circumstances is clearly pointed out?
Here are the identical words uttered by him as soon as he inhaled the fresh air of freedom, after the faintness occasioned by his sojourn in his temporary tomb had passed away.

HYMN OF THANKSGIVING,
After being released from his confinement in the Box, at Philadelphia.

I waited patiently, I waited patiently for the Lord, for the Lord,
And he inclined unto me, and heard my calling;
I waited patiently, I waited patiently for the Lord,
And he inclined unto me, and heard my calling;
Andhe hath put a new song in my mouth,
Ev'n a thanksgiving, Ev'n a thanksgiving, Ev'n a thanksgiving unto our God.


Blessed, Blessed, Blessed, Blessed is the man, Blessed is the man,
Blessed is the man that hath set his hope, his hope in the Lord;
O Lord my God, Great, Great, Great,
Great are the wondrous works which thou hast done,
Great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, which thou hast done,
Great are the wondrous works,
Great are the wondrous works,
Great are the wondrous works, which thou hast done.

## CONTEXT: 

Now, St. Andrews Lodge, white, of Boston, from 1752 to 1760, without any authority from the Grand Lodge of England, had held meetings as a Masonic Lodge, and had entered, passed and raised its members to the various degrees which    was shockingly illegal and irregular.    This lodge furnished to the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts its first provincial Grand Master in the person of Joseph Warren, the famous hero of the battle of Bunker Hill and this lodge is responsible for the age-long libel which impugned the legality and regularity of Prince Hall's warrant, and Prince Hall Lodge's standing as a Masonic unit.The white men of culture of that period, while perhaps not quite as pronounced as they are at the present day in their feelings toward the Negro, felt keenly the action of the Grand Lodge of England in making and placing black men on a par with them in the Masonic fraternity.It hurt, and so they began to discredit the Prince Hall Masons, to spread the rumor, that its warrant was not regular, but tainted.For years the Prince Hall Masons were the victims of this subtle and vicious attempt of white Masons to read it out of the fraternity, but it is still in the position among regular Masons in which the Grand Lodge of England placed it in 1784.
Now let us for a moment look into the Masonic record of the author of these attacks on Prince Hall Masonry, (the white St. Andrews Lodge No.82, of Boston).It appears from the record that in January, 1776, this Lodge made a formal tender to St. Johns Lodge of the same city, to be received by it whenever it might be agreeable to St. Johns Lodge, that there might be a happy coalition.But St. Johns Lodge rebuffed it in four votes.
(1)
 >> Claiming that the nine persons (naming them) who were the only ones named as Masons in the Charter to St. Andrews Lodge, were not at the date of their application for it, or at the date of constitution Free and Accepted Masons.

 >> (2) That applying as such was an imposition on the Grand Lodge of Scotland.

 >> (3) That they are irregular Masons, and all persons who have since been added to them in their fraternity.
This, of course, included Gen. Joseph Warren, who was made in the Scottish Lodge in 1761.
(4) That as members of such irregular lodge, some attempting to visit their regular lodges, had been refused this liberty and that by vote of the Grand Lodge, visits of their members to said irregular lodge has been prohibited, therefore, this answer is given to the written request to visit your lodge: THAT THE FREE AND ACCEPTED MASONS under this jurisdiction cannot visit said fraternity.This verdict against the spurious St. Andrews Lodge, was sent to the proper officers of that lodge, and to the Grand Lodge of England, by St. Johns Lodge of Boston who knew the facts of the bastardy of St. Andrews Lodge and was itself irregular as I, shall presently show.This St. Andrews Lodge, I repeat, had tabooed African Lodge No.459 as irregular and therefore outside, he pale of free and accepted Masonry.I think you have noted as I have proceeeded with the story, that St. Andrews Lodge did not come into court with clean hands.
Thus it is shown that its own title was cloudy, tainted, and that its members had not even attained to the dignity of becoming Masons, in the way and manner prescribed by the ancient laws of the order, and that therere it was not competent to pass upon the legality of the act of the Grand Lodge of England in making Prince Hall and the body of men associated with him, regular Free and Accepted Masons, by granting them a warrant as a further evidence of the confidence it reposed in him and his associates to guard sacredly and safely the great trust imposed upon them as Master Masons.The title of Prince Hall Lodge, and of all the Lodges emanating from it, under its warrant is as clear as the noonday sun, and as valid as any warrant held by any Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons, anywhere in the world.

## CONTEXT: 

At one time when he was away and was brought home, one of his arms was tied and he was put in care of a keeper who made him work with the other slaves, days, and put him in confinement nights, but for all this he got away from his keeper and went into the woods again.The last time he ran away two white men were hired to hunt him; they had about twenty-five blood hounds, but this time Monday fell in with another slave who had run away from his master and had been in the woods seven years, and they together were able to kill a greater portion of the hounds.Finally the white man caught his companion, but did not catch Monday, though they chased him two or three days longer, but he came home himself; they did not whip him and he went to work in the field.Things went on very nicely with him for two or three weeks, until one day a white man was seen riding through the field with the overseer, of course the slaves did not mistrust his object, as white men often visited master's plantation, but that night when all the slaves were sleeping, the man that was seen in the daytime went to the door of Monday's cabin and called him out of his bed, and when he came to his door, the stranger whom he had never seen before that day, handcuffed him and said    You now belong to me.    Most of the slaves found it out, as Monday was put into a cart and carried through the streets of the negro quarters, and there was quite an excitement, but Monday was never heard from again.
THE STORY OF JAMES HAY.
There was a slave named James Hay, who belonged to a neighbor of master's, he was punished a great many times because he could not get his task done.The other slaves pitied him because he seemed unable to perform his task.One evening he got a severe whipping, the next morning as the slaves were having their tasks assigned them, an old lady by the name of Aunt Patience went by, and said,    never mind, Jim, my son, the Lord will help you with your task to-day;    he answered,    yes, ma'am.    He began his work very faithfully and continued until it was half done, then he lay down under a tree; the others, not understanding his motive, thought he was tired and was taking a rest, but he did not return to his task until the overseer called him and asked him why he did not have his work nearer done.
 >> He said,    Aunt Patience told me dis morning that the Lord would help me to-day, and I thought as I did half of the task, the Lord might have finished the other half if he intended to help me at all.    

 >> The overseer said,    You see that the Lord did not come to help you and we shall not wait for him, but we will help you;    so Jim got a severe punishment.

 >> Sometime after this, Jim Hay was called upon by some professors of religion; they asked him if he was not tired of serving the devil, and told him that the Lord was good and had helped many of his people, and would help all who asked him and then take them home to heaven.
Jim said that if the Lord would not do half an acre of his task for him when he depended on him, he did not think he could trust him, and Jim never became a Christian to my knowledge.
THE STORY OF MR. USOM AND JACK.
One Sunday when the boys were at the overseer's, Mr. Usom's house, as we generally were, he said to one,    Jack, don't you think that Hell is a very hot place, if it is as they describe it?    Jack said,    yes, massa.    Mr. Usom said,    well, how do you think it will be with poor fellows that have to go there?       Well, Massa Bob, I will tell you what I tinks about it, I tinks us niggers need not trouble usselves about hell, as the white folks.       How is that, Jack?    Jack answered,    because us niggers have to work out in the hot sun, and if us go to hell it would not be so bad for us because us used to heat, but it will be bad for white folks because they is not used to hot weather.

## CONTEXT: 

But, in consequence of the reports that have reached me, I hope I may safely admit that you are measurably friendly and well disposed toward us.I trust that you will agree with me in thinking that one universal Father hath given being to us all; that he has not only made us all of one flesh, but has also, without partiality, afforded us all the same sensations and endowed us all with the same faculties; and that, however various we may be in society or religion, however diversified in situation or color, we are all of the same family and all stand in the same relation to Him.Now, sir, if this is founded in truth, I apprehend you will readily embrace every opportunity to eradicate the absurd and false ideas and opinions which so generally prevail with respect to us.
Suffer me, sir, to recall to your mind that when the tyranny of the British crown was exerted to reduce you to servitude, your abhorrence thereof was so excited that you publicly held forth this true and invaluable doctrine, worthy to be recorded and remembered in all succeeding ages:    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   
Your tender feelings for yourselves engaged you thus to declare.You were then impressed with proper ideas of the great value of liberty, and the free possession of those blessings to which you are entitled by nature.But, sir, how pitiable it is to reflect that, although you are so fully convinced of the benevolence of the Father of mankind, and of his equal and impartial distribution of those rights and privileges which He had conferred upon them, that you should at the same time counteract His mercies in detaining, by fraud and violence, so numerous a part of my brethren under groaning captivity and cruel oppression; that you should at the same time be found guilty of that most criminal act which you detested in others with respect to yourselves.
Sir, I freely and most cheerfully acknowledge that I am of the African race; and in that color which is natural to them I am of the deepest dye.But, with a sense of the most profound gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of the universe, I confess that I am not under that state of tyrannical thraldom and inhuman captivity to which so many of my brethren are doomed.I have abundantly tasted of those blessings which proceed from that free and unequaled liberty with which you are favored.
Sir, I suppose your knowledge of the situation of my brethren is too extensive for it to need a recital here.
 >> Neither shall I presume to prescribe methods by which they may be relieved, otherwise than by recommending to you and others to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices you have imbibed with respect to them, and to do as Job proposed to his friends      put your souls in their souls' stead.    

 >> Thus shall your hearts be enlarged with kindness and benevolence toward them, and you will need neither the direction of myself or others in what manner to proceed.

 >> I took up my pen to direct to you, as a present, a copy of an Almanac I have calculated for the succeeding year.
I ardently hope that your candor and generosity will plead with you in my behalf.Sympathy and affection for my brethren has caused my enlargement thus far; it was not originally my design.
The Almanac is a production of my arduous study.I have long had unbounded desires to become acquainted with the secrets of nature, and I have had to gratify my curiousity herein through my own assiduous application to astronomical study, in which I need not recount to you the many difficulties and disadvantages I have had to encounter.I conclude by subscribing myself, with the most profound respect, your most humble servant,
B. BANNEKER.
To this letter Jefferson made the following reply:
Sir, I thank you sincerely for your letter, and for the Almanac it contained.Nobody wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit that nature has given to our black brethren talents equal to those of the other colors of men, and that the appearance of a want of them is owing only to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa and America.I can add, with truth, that no one wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition, both of their body and mind, to what it ought be, as fast as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstances which cannot be neglected, will admit.

## CONTEXT: 

The object of my being secreted, was to prevent my being seen by the adjoining neighbors, who should perchance pass by that way to Court.About this time, he had become very much reduced in circumstances; his farm, and all that he owned was in a few days to pass out of his possession, by a public vendue.The law of the State of Delaware, was at that time, that all colored people, whether slaves or apprentices, fared alike; apprentices at the age of 16 or 17, becoming dissatisfied with one master, had a right to choose another.In a day or two after, he had plotted his nefarious scheme for my destruction   he sent me to the mill, and also to do an errand at a place called Stanton, where his first wife's relatives resided, and to see his two children who were then living with an aunt of theirs, by the name of Molly Pierce; she was an excellent woman, it was from her I learnt of what was going on.

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust him for his grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

Mrs. Pierce being fully apprised of the danger to which I was exposed, persuaded me not to return home, but to hasten my escape.I told her no, that the animal I had was blind and could not find its way back.Upon my return home I went to the stable, and while there, the moon shone with magnificent splendor; I looked and saw him on his crutch.es, advancing towards me; and when he approached me, he commenced detailing what he wanted me to do, not being aware that I had on that afternoon learned the whole secret.He commenced by saying,    Thee knows that to-morrow is my vendue, and thy time will be sold?   
 >> thee knows that James Covington and James Holingsworth, both wants thee, and I have determined that they shall not have thee, because they will not treat thee well: but there is a man in Baltimore that wants thee for a waiter? (at that suggestion my mind began to waver; the idea of living in a city, was very desirable to me,) and I want thee to get up to morrow morning early, and go down to Elcy Williams; thee knows where she lives; and she will take thee.

 >> I don't want thee to stay about the house in the daytime, but stay in the woods, and in the evening thee can come up to the house, because if thee stays about in the daytime, some of the neighbors will see thee; for they will be passing that way to court; and I will come down to night or to-morrow night upon old Lock, and slip thee off.    

 >> Upon this understanding, I went to the house and went to bed, not letting him know but what I would do as he had requested.
But I did not awake in the morning, until he called me; the sun was now up, and it was too late for me to go to Elcy Williams, for I should have been discovered by the neighbors, and he said,    now if thee will go down here to Jinny Grub's huckleberry swamp, and lay there till evening, and then get up, and go on, for it is very pleasant moonlight nights, and if thee will do as I tell thee, I will give thee my gold watch, and the price of thy freedom clothes.    Upon this he started up stairs to get his watch, but soon returned, saying that he could not find it; but that he would look it up and bring it with him.I started off, and went on till I passed by the swamp, and arrived to a high hill, called Quaker Hill; here the roads forked.I stopped with my arms folded, to determine which of these roads to take.The road to the right, would have placed me in hopeless bondage, while the road to the left beyond the reach of the dark demon of American Slavery   beyond the land of whips and chains and blood-thirsty slave holders.I finally determined to pursue the road to the left.In passing by the house where said Wiser lived, (he being from home,) his wife who was standing on the piazza, hailed and told me to hasten my escape.
This gave me to believe that she was fully apprised of the circumstances surrounding my case, and upon my arrival at Stanton, where I had been the previous evening, I called upon Mrs. Pierce, and she told me that I had better hasten on, (with a letter of introduction, she had procured from Squire Craig,) to Judge Richardson who lived upon Quaker Hill, back of Wilmington, Del., where I arrived about twelve o'clock.

In the morning I again sought the woods for safety and rest.
If any one wishes to know what were my feelings during this time, let them imagine themselves a slave, with the strong arm of the law extended over their heads   doomed, if retaken, to a severe punishment, and almost unendurable torture.Compelled to toil from day to day, subject to the hardships and cruelties of such toil as slaves only know, with none but fellow sufferers to sympathise with him, and they unable to afford relief   with no prospect of a better state, for life   deprived of the blessings of knowledge and the sweets of intellectual pursuit.Seing all the free white people around him happy in the possession of friends and the blessings of life and himself a crushed, degraded being. Desiring to arise, but unable to do so.Then imagine yourself on the road, flying for liberty among your enemies, alone, unarmed, trembling at every step with the greatest anxiety and with fear.Sleeping during the day alone in the wilderness, exposed to wild beasts and serpents; hungry, lame, and almost spirit broken   starting up from a disturbed sleep, with frightful dreams of arrest and torture.Hunted and chased during the day by men of no heart, and with ferocious dogs, trained to the pursuit   the faint gleams of freedom now shooting up, and then lost in darkness   hope and despair constantly filling your heart.This was my situation for weeks.But thank God, I can now look back upon that volume of trying scenes and feel   they are past, and rejoice in the sweet behests of my God-given rights.
In the morning of the next day, as I was traveling leisurely along, I saw a boy watching me very closely.
 >> As I came up within a few rods of the house, he darted into it.   

 >> I suspected his errand, and instead of going on   turned back, carefully crouching in the shade of the fence until I came to a group of bushes: behind these I ran on until I came into an open field, in an opposite direction from that they had supposed me to be going, little dreaming that I had been watched by others, who were in pursuit of me and had taken ambush in several places.

 >> But I was not long in this ignorance   for as I was urging my way through the field to a larger piece of woods, and just upon the point of scaling a fence, a man sprang up like a tiger from the side of a log and struck at me.
Quick as I could, I turned and ran a few steps and bounded over the fence.Just as my feet struck the ground, a club grazed my shoulder, but did me no harm; a little way ahead, I saw another man and dog, with a boy and horse.The man had a gun.Now, thought I, are my hopes blasted.I had heard about the Israelites when they fled from the slavery of Egypt.I thought I was like them.Before and behind me are death.I almost sank down with despair   but rallied again, determined to sell my life and liberty together, or to gain them.

I could discover no trace of home, only the pleasing and conspicuous views of my native town.When I turned round, I found my companions before me.The anticipated sport, caused my heart to leap with joy, I ran down the declivity of the hill, we reached the Neboah; about 10 o'clock in the morning, we went down upon a point or rather elbow of the river, just above the junction of the small river before mentioned with the Niger.
There was a small shade of grape vines under which there was a smooth flat of green grass, we quickly and hastily undressed ourselves and prepared for the consummation of our wishes; kings upon their thrones might envy our felicity.As we could anticipate no greater pleasure, and knew no care.

All objections to charitable contributions may well be supposed to arise from covetousness, or an unwillingness to part with the present penny.Covetousness is indeed a Goliah, a giant of the first magnitude, which is always ready to defy and set at nought the best formed arguments and motives drawn from reason and Scripture, all the armies of the living God.All the common pretences to prudence in the manner or time of giving charity, all hints of reserving it for better purposes, generally centre in covetousness, in the love of money: and how wretched a fruit is to be expected from the root of all evil, as St. Paul expressly calls it, let every one judge for himself.
But the answer to all such pretences of prudence in bestowing, in short, is this: you may be deceived in the object, but you never can be deceived in your intention of charity, be the object ever go undeserving; nay, should I bestow money upon one in apparent necessity, who might abuse it to ill purposes, yet the good intention sanctifies my gift, consecrates it to God, and insures me a blessing, because it was done in his name and for his sake; while the whole abuse of it rests upon the guilty head of the vile person who thus basely misapplies my good deed.It may indeed be a reasonable objection against my giving a second time to that same person, but can be no excuse to me for withholding my hand from the relief of any other object which may appear another time to be in real want of charity.
And O! consider what a joyful thing it must be for a person in a dying hour to have a conscience free from offence, and to see their blessed Saviour, with his arms stretched out, ready to receive them when their breath leaves the body, and saying,    Well done, thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.    Are not these, my brethren and sisters, pleasures worth seeking after?are not these privileges, this freedom, and these possessions of far more value than thousands of worlds like this we live in, which we must all leave in a short time, and cannot carry with us into another life?And can you ever sufficiently admire the goodness of God, or ever be thankful enough to him for his loving kindness, who hath set these glories and these enjoyments as much within the reach of the poorest slave as of the greatest prince alive?
 >> For it is not power and high station that can purchase these heavenly possessions: they are only to be gained by goodness and serving of God; and the lowest of us can serve God as well as the richest person here below, and, by that means may adorn the doctrine of the Lord your God in all things, and bring more honour to Christ than many of higher rank and condition, who are not so careful of their souls as you may be.

 >> When, therefore, we shall leave this impertinent and unsociable world, and all our good old friends that are gone to heaven before us, shall meet us as soon as we are landed upon the shore of eternity, and with infinite congratulations for our safe arrival, shall conduct us into the company of patriarchs, prophets, apostles and martyrs, and introduce us into an intimate acquaintance with them, and with all those brave and generous souls, who, by their glorious examples, have recommended themselves to the world; when we shall be familiar friends with angels and archangels; and all the courtiers of heaven shall call us brethren, and bid us welcome to their master's joy, and we shall be received into their glorious society with all the tender endearments and caresses of those heavenly lovers.

 >> What a mighty addition to our happiness will this be!
There are indeed some other additions to the happiness of heaven, such as the glory and magnificence of the place, which is the highest heaven, or the upper and purer tracts of the   ther, which our Saviour calls Paradise.
In the temper of every wicked mind there is a strong antipathy to the pleasures of Heaven, which being all chaste, pure and spiritual, can never agree with the vitiated palate of a base and degenerate soul.For what concord can there be between a spiteful and devilish spirit, and the fountain of all love and goodness? between a sensual and carnalized one, that understands no other pleasures but only those of the flesh, and those pure and virgin spirits that neither eat nor drink but live forever upon wisdom, holiness, love and contemplation?Certainly till our mind is contempered to the Heavenly state, and we are of the same disposition with God and angels and saints, there is no pleasure in Heaven that can be agreeable to us.For as in the main we shall be of the same temper and disposition when we come into the other life as we are when we leave this, it being unimaginable how a total change should be wrought in us merely by passing out of one world into another, and therefore as in this world it is likeness that does congregate and associate beings together, so doubtless it is in the other world too, so that if we carry with us thither our wicked and devilish dispositions, (as we shall certainly do, unless we subdue and mortify them here) there will be no company fit for us to associate with, but only the devilish and damned ghost of wicked men, with whom our wretched spirits being already joined by a likeness of nature, will mingle themselves as soon as ever they are excommunicated from the society of mortals.
For whither should they flock but to the birds of their own feather, with whom should they associate but with those malignant spirits, to whom they are already joined by a community of nature?So that supposing that when they land in eternity?it were left to their own choice to go to Heaven or hell, into the society of the blessed or the damned, it is plain that Heaven would be no place for them; that the air of that bright region of eternal day, would never agree with their black and hellish natures, for alas! what should they do among those blessed beings that inhabit it?

THE SUN MOVES!   
He only asked a careful consideration of what he was going to say, and he got all his facts from the Bible.He appealed to the ladies and gentlemen present to go with him in his argument, and said:    When I undertake to prove that the sun moves, I shall expect every lady and gentleman present this evening to say whether that be so or not, after they hear what I have got to say.I shall only ask reasonable questions. I shall have some right smart work to do in Egypt before I ask you any questions, and I shall be philosophizing words to show the ground I take that the sun moves.I hold that ladies and gentlemen must respect it if I produce it by evidence of the Bible, and not by notion. I will undertake to prove, by Bible authority, that the sun moves.I want everybody to look at my authorities.   
The preacher then handed to the ladies and gentlemen a slip of paper, upon which he had written the passages of Scripture which he proposed to quote during the evening, and requested them to pass the paper around so that all might read.
   SOME SMART WORK IN EGYPT.   
The minister then proceeded, as he had indicated before,    to do some smart work in Egypt.   
   
 >> The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.      

 >> This is the text,    said he;    and in order to prove that God be a man of war, we shall have, in the first place, to trace Providence in Egypt.   

 >> He then proceeded to give a graphic sketch of the Israelites, beginning with Abraham, whom God had chosen to make the father of a nation.
He spoke eloquently of Abraham's obedience to God's command, and dwelt particularly on the proposed sacrifice of Isaac, who, he said, God had early liked.    God looked on that boy in his infancy; I suppose he estimated that boy very high,    said the preacher, facing his white auditors.
The speaker then spoke of how God tempted Abraham and tried his faith to see whether or not he relied on His promises.
ABRAHAM'S PROPOSED ASSASSINATION OF ISAAC.
Mr. Jasper, whose warmth and eloquence was increasing as he spoke of Abraham and Isaac, kept his audience spell-bound by a thrilling picture drawn from the scriptural account of the sacrifice.He depicted with great force the feelings of the father, who was about to slay his beloved son, and kept the interest of the vast congregation right to the point where Abraham was about to raise his arm to strike the fatal blow,    when,    said Mr. Jasper,    when he was about to slay his son, there was an angel of God in the bushes near by, who said,    Lay not thine hand on him.Draw in that arm which is about to assassinate him.Let your son live, that my promises be fulfilled.

They said if they had a plenty of such men as myself they would soon be equal to all other races.They said that I was the smartest man in the South, and not only the smartest man in the South, but the smartest man in the world.They said that no man on earth could build that institution as I did without means to start with, and they knew that I had no means to start with, and they did not want me to take all of that responsibility upon myself; they thought that I would make a failure, and it would be injurious to the race.
I had no person to give me an introduction to the Northern men.I was a stranger among them all.I was not so fortunate as my friend, Booker T. Washington, in having a friend like General Armstrong to introduce me to friends in the North, East and West.I had no person to loan me a dollar to start with, I admit, as my white friends and colored friends said.We have a Board of Directors, and they tried to raise money, but they could not raise twenty-five dollars, and they said,    You will have to build this school or it will not be built.    So I prayed and worked.I prayed in season and out of season, and worked in season and out of season.

 >> The State has not given the school a dollar, but it does not charge any taxes on the school property.

 >> I would work hard all day, in a half run, and sometimes running.

 >> I would be so tired when I reached my hotel I could hardly eat my supper.
Many times I would find it necessary to get up out of my bed at one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning to take a train to meet an appointment at nine o'clock in the morning.I never failed in being on time.
CHAPTER VII.
LYNCHINGS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
I desire to say a word concerning the lynchings in the Southern States, that our friends in the North, East and West hear so much of.I claim that it comes from ignorance among the colored people that such extreme depredations as assaulting white ladies of the South takes place.I am prepared to show you, in nine cases out of ten, it comes from ignorance.Education and sufficient moral training, with religion combined, are the only things that will stop it.

I followed my Lord and Master in the Jordan in the year of our Lord 1866, and those sweet moments have never left me once.As the years go by they seem to be the more sweet to my sinful soul, and I am trying to wing my way to these bright mansions above, where I shall meet those dear ones who have gone before.
I have had some of the darkest days of my life while on this voyage of life, but when it is dark Jesus says,    Peace, be still and fear not, for I will pilot thee.   
And then my heart can sing:

   Jesus, Saviour, pilot me
Over life's tempestuous sea,
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rocks and treacherous shoals,
Chart and compass come from Thee,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.   

I know that He has led me through paths seen and unseen andhas been my pilot, for we have been called to pass through many a dark trial, but God has been able for it all.
My dear mother had four of her children called home to heaven within a short time.Some of them left her for the land of love in the same month, and there seemed like nothing but God's displeasure on us, but it was God's love to us, for we know that they are safe from all harm and danger in this world of sin and distress.Some of them I never saw more after landing in this city, but I shall see them and know them when I shall have fought the blessed battle on this side, and the victory shall be on the Lord's side.Then I can sing with the angels above:

   Crown Him, Crown Him, angels,
Crown Him, Crown Him King of Kings,
Crown Him, Crown Him, angels,
Crown Him, Crown Him, Crown the Saviour King of Kings.   

What joy there will be to crown Him as our Heavenly King and to know that we are the inhabitants of that kingdom.
CHAPTER III.

 >> I WAS baptized by the Rev. David Moore, the pastor of the Washington Avenue Church, who is one of the best beloved ones on this earth, for he never overlooked me in the time that my soul needed the Lord Jesus Christ to save me from my sins and make me a child of the King, which makes me what I am to day.

 >> I bless God that he ever put it in my dear mother's mind to come to this place, for she was not a Christian, and the heaviest burden that I have carried was praying for one that was the head of the great family where she should have been a leader of her dear ones to the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.

 >> But God be praised for a little one to lead so many, for of all the people of mothers there was not one that knew of this love of God, and how many were the souls given for me to work for.
I told my mother that I had found Jesus and was going to follow Him.She said,    My child, you are too young, I am afraid that you will not hold out.    And I said,    Mother, if I should look to myself I should fail, but I look to Jesus.I have given my life and He can hold me in the power of His might and can keep me from failing; so I can not go against your will, but I must follow Him, for you know how He has saved me from sickness so many times, and now the time has come for me to pay my vows unto Him for making me His own.    I went forward in the way that He marked out for me and then to pray that she might be saved.
My grandma was almost one hundred years old, and when she heard that the Lord had saved me and that I was praying for her she saw her own sins and asked me to come on to visit all of my people, and I, getting ready, got my oldest sister to go with me.I found that the way was opened for work, as there we began the work, and they were looking to see something that they would never see in this world, and sweetly they were all brought to the Saviour.Grandma went home to carry the good news and some of the rest have gone with the same good news.

6.The past is fled.the future not;

To seek no other way but thine.


Verses written by the late DIVIE BETHUNE, after returning from Ch where a collection had been made for the poor, Nov. 29th, 1807.


1. WHY are our hearts so prone to hoard
The blessings lent us by the Lord?
Why can we see a brother feel
The pangs of want, yet clothe in steel.


2.The God who gives, adds this command,
   To thy poor brother stretch thy hand;   
But nature, fall'n, deprav'd, and blind
For self shuts out the human kind.


3.The widow's and the orphan's tear
God sees: their cry assails his ear,
And he commands us from on high
To wipe that tear, and soothe that sigh.



 >> 4.

 >> And can the Lord's commandment fail?

 >> Shall not his powerful voice prevail?
Yield, yield thy soul to generous bliss,
   The Lord can give thee more than this.   


5.Yea ev'n on earth, he'll prove his power
And as thou giv'st enlarge thy store;
And with the grace he will impart,
Pour joy on thy expanding heart.


6.That God who says,    my will be done   
Gave thee poor soul, his only son;
Receive his gift, on him believe,
Thou poor one sav'd, His poor relieve,


7.Earth's miser! though thy pile be high,
'Twill soon be lost, for thou must die;
The house, as narrow as thy heart,
Shuts out this wealth, thy better part.


8.The liberal soul the poor who tends,
And to their dwellings comfort sends,
When he ascends the op'ning sky,
Finds all his wealth increased on high.

I had a sentiment of honor on the subject.The duties of the slave to his master as appointed over him in the Lord, I had ever heard urged by ministers and religious men.It seemed like outright stealing.And now I felt the devil was getting the upper hand of me.Strange as all this may seem, I really felt it then.Entrancing as the idea was, that the coast was clear for a run for freedom, that I might liberate my companions, might carry off my wife and children, and some day own a house and land, and be no longer despised and abused   still my notions of right were against it.I had promised my master to take his property to Kentucky, and deposit it with his brother Amos.Pride, too, came in to confirm me.I had undertaken a great thing; my vanity had been flattered all along the road by hearing myself praised; I thought it would be a feather in my cap to carry it through thoroughly; and had often painted the scene in my imagination of the final surrender of my charge to master Amos, and the immense admiration and respect with which he would regard me.
Under the influence of these impressions, and seeing that the allurements of the crowd were producing a manifest effect, I sternly assumed the captain, and ordered the boat to be pushed off into the stream.
 >> A shower of curses followed me from the shore; but the negroes under me, accustomed to obey, and, alas! too degraded and ignorant of the advantages of liberty to know what they were forfeiting, offered no resistance to my command.

 >> Often since that day has my soul been pierced with bitter anguish at the thought of having been thus instrumental in consigning to the infernal bondage of slavery so many of my fellow-beings.

 >> I have wrestled in prayer with God for forgiveness.
Having experienced myself the sweetness of liberty, and knowing too well the after misery of numbers of many of them, my infatuation has seemed to me the unpardonable sin.But I console myself with the thought that I acted according to my best light, though the light that was in me was darkness.Those were my days of ignorance.I knew not the glory of free manhood.I knew not that the title-deed of the slave-owner is robbery and outrage.
What advantages I may have personally lost by thus throwing away an opportunity of obtaining freedom, I know not; but the perception of my own strength of character, the feeling of integrity, the sentiment of high honor, I thus gained by obedience to what I believed right, these advantages I do know and prize.He that is faithful over a little, will alone be faithful over much.Before God, I tried to do my best, and the error of judgment lies at the door of the degrading system under which I had been nurtured.

Gondar is situated upon the summit and sides of an isolated hill, and has, in days past, been a place of some importance.It consists of a great many dilapidated houses, a number of ill constructed churches and other buildings devoted to religious purposes, and has the one redeeming quality of producing a species of fine cotton cloth from its looms.The male inhabitants, with few exceptions, live in a state of habitual intoxication, on a fiery liquor of native manufacture, and seldom exert themselves farther than to beat the women and make them do all the work, for their drunken masters.
We remained here about two months, when having procured a number of native guides, we directed our course to Massawa, a seaport on the Red Sea.
These faithful Abyssinian guides of of ours, while piloting us through the wilderness, frequently appropriated articles of my master's property, almost openly.He was afraid to say anything to them about it, however, lest they should kill him; and this system of privilege went on until they left us.About two days journey from Massawa, our guides forsook us, after having first broken open the box in which was my master's money, and abstracted therefrom a considerable sum.
Fortunately for us, my master had had two leather belts made at Cairo, in which he had placed his gold; and one of these having been fastened round his waist and the other around mine, the thieves failed to discover it, and we lost none of that.
In sight of where our guides left us, there was a small village, which we reached without difficulty, and were cordially welcomed by the inhabitants, whom we found to be Egyptian subjects.The name of this place was Domba, and as soon as the authorities had been informed of the manner in which we had been treated by the Abyssinian guides, a detachment of twenty five horsemen were dispatched in pursuit of the thieves.

 >> In the meantime, our wants were carefully provided for, and we were made quite comfortable among our new friends.

 >> At the end of five days, the soldiers returned, bringing our guides with them, all chained together.

 >> They returned Hadji Daoud, his clothing and other articles that had been taken from him, but reported that they could find no money.
The Abyssinians said the soldiers had appropriated the money, the soldiers said they lied, and so, in the midst of the confusion thus created, my master decided to leave without his money.
We learned afterwards, while at Massawa, that the soldiers released the thieves as soon as we had taken our departure.We arrived at Massawa in less than two days from Domba, and only tarried there until a boat arrived in which we might make the trip to Jidda, the nearest seaport to Mecca.
It was found, as soon as we had reached Massawa, that in order to reach Jidda, we had to tarry a long time.Accordingly we got on board of a small craft bound for Zeila, and reached that place in about ten uneventful days of sail.Zeila is situated on the western shore of the Red Sea, in an extensive plain, inhabited by a numerous population, consisting of Arabs, Abyssinians, and the Somaulis, who trade in rhinoceras' horns, ostrich plumes, etc.
The name of this champaign country is Adel, and is ruled by a chief, subject to the government of Egypt.At Zeila, the plain enters the sea in the form of a low, sandy cape, and inaccessible to vessels of large draughts.

As soon as he was left sole dictator, he thought the time had come to put his threats into execution.He soon began to find fault with Randall, and threatened to whip him, if he did not do better.One day he gave him a very hard task,   more than he could possibly do; and at night, the task not being performed, he told Randall that he should remember him the next morning.On the following morning, after the hands had taken breakfast, Cook called out to Randall, and told him that he intended to whip him, and ordered him to cross his hands and be tied.Randall asked why he wished to whip him.He answered, because he had not finished his task the day before.Randall said that the task was too great, or he should have done it.Cook said it made no difference,   he should whip him.Randall stood silent for a moment, and then said,    Mr. Cook, I have always tried to please you since you have been on the plantation, and I find you are determined not to be satisfied with my work, let me do as well as I may.No man has laid hands on me, to whip me, for the last ten years, and I have long since come to the conclusion not to be whipped by any man living.    
 >> Cook, finding by Randall's determined look and gestures, that he would resist, called three of the hands from their work, and commanded them to seize Randall, and tie him.

 >> The hands stood still;   they knew Randall     and they also knew him to be a powerful man, and were afraid to grapple with him.

 >> As soon as Cook had ordered the men to seize him, Randall turned to them, and said      Boys, you all know me; you know that I can handle any three of you, and the man that lays hands on me shall die.
This white man can't whip me himself, and therefore he has called you to help him.    The overseer was unable to prevail upon them to seize and secure Randall, and finally ordered them all to go to their work together.
Nothing was said to Randall by the overseer, for more than a week.One morning, however, while the hands were at work in the field, he came into it, accompanied by three friends of his, Thompson, Woodbridge and Jones.They came up to where Randall was at work, and Cook ordered him to leave his work, and go with them to the barn.He refused to go; whereupon he was attacked by the overseer and his companions, when he turned upon them, and laid them, one after another, prostrate on the ground.Woodbridge drew out his pistol, and fired at him, and brought him to the ground by a pistol ball.The others rushed upon him with their clubs, and beat him over the head and face, until they succeeded in tying him.

RICHMOND,Friday, 21st Dec., 1810.
General Peter Johnston, and others, members of the Committee for Courts of Justice, of the Assembly of Virginia, esqrs: Permit me gentlemen, to address you in your private characters as gentlemen; perceiving by this day's debate, that I have not that liberty (which I thought I had) of speaking on my case before the honorable the committee, I beg leave to state, that my wife is now, and has been for some time past, so lame with pains in her limbs that at times she can only rise with great difficulty, when she is down.And that she is a member of the Baptist Society here, and has a wish regularly to attend worship.During the association here last fall, Mr. Wickham, knowing all the circumstances of my case, politely loaned me his carriage and servant, and carried my wife to attend the association.And that I could not get redress against the common hall, by law, will readily be seen by reference being had to the two certificates, refusing to hire me a carriage..Had a carriage been hired me, and I was stoped by the master of police, or an officer under him, I then could have sued them, and thereby have tried the legality of the power which the hall assumed, in preventing me the use of a carriage; as this was not to be done as above, I saw no proper way of getting redress, but in an appeal to the honorable the General Assembly, and of this, I took the first counsel in the land.And my being engaged in a mercantile line of life, I cannot spare funds, with convenience, to buy me a carriage and horses.I also beg leave, humbly to advance here cogent reasons for the letter with seven seals to beopened by, or before the committee, because the enclosures, and especially the address to the President and Senate of the United States, regards the justice that is due to myself, yourself, &c., &c., &c.
All I want and all I ask for is complete justice; and I trust, in the candor and justice of the honorable board, that no act of theirs will, in the least degree, tarnish or sully the fair character which they have an indubitable right to maintain, correspondent with their fundamental laws and constitution   independent of the influence which bodies, corporate or incorporate, may claim of them over my just and unalienable rights and privileges.And in fact, whose acts are equally under their cognizance.

 >> In the first place, I shall expressly waive any kind of comment whatever, upon the serious injuries I have sustained by the management of a public pecuniary institution here, which chiefly fosters men of opulence, and indeed strangers who own no real estate, in preference to many a needy, worthy, revolutionary character, who assisted to estabiish the freedom of Columbia; and strangers too, whom, as soon as they are enriched, retire with their booty to nerve foreign climes; and to some of those very strangers my exigencies have obliged me to pay uncommon usury; altho I waded thro the revolutionary war, and some debts of the rich, yet God has been pleased to bless my exertions with lots and houses in and about the city, a farm near this city,* and part of a ship, upwards of 300 ton burthen, in which last spring, I shipped to Europe 40 hhds.

 >> tobabco on my own account, and am now putting corn aboard her, for my part of her present outward bound cargo; but I shall hasten to a very great grievance indeed.*

 >> My partners are white men of the first respectability.
On the 16th day of June, 1810, the free people of color in this city, petitioned the common hall to grant them a new and eligible burying ground, and to this day, a lapse of more than six months, I have never heard of any report of the committee on the case.Several who signed the memorial, and others, have since died, and were buried in that disgustful old burying ground, whose names I have inserted on a copy of a memorial which I have, and in which is a copy of the proceedings of the hall, with the courses of 28   acres of land, in the suburbs, belonging to the corporation, towards which, no doubt, the people of colour paid a part in the taxes levied upon them.
I had an inspection, the other day, made of the present burying ground.It lies directly east of the Baptist meeting house, uninclosed, very much confined as to space, under a steep hill, on the margin of Shockoe Creek, where every heavy rain commits ravages upon some one grave or another, and some coffins have already been washed away into the current of Shockoe stream, and in a very few years the major part of them will no doubt be washed down into the current of James river; added to this, many graves are on private property adjoining, liable to be taken up and thrown away, whenever the ground is wanted by its owners, (this is owing, either to confined space, or want of knowledge of what was public ground;) and furthermore, we may add the humiliating circumstance, that this is the very express gallows ground where malefactors are interred.I ruminated on this ghastly scene; and now, thought I, were I in a barbarous land, and such a sight like this was to present itself to my view, I should exclaim to myself, these are a poor, ignorant people.The blessing even of a solitary ray of gospel light has never shone upon them, neither has civilization, nor the age of reason, made any approaches towards their savage habitations.
Notwithstanding they had perfect knowledge of the situation of this offensive place, the rulers of the city had taken up out of her grave, last spring, a woman, a poor widow, the second day after she was buried, in her own bona fide ground on an eminence, and carried down to this mock of a grave yard. Shocking to humanity!O!

 >> I looked for him to come that day to the sale, but he did not.

 >> I bowed down on my kness   here's faith   and asked God not to let him reach that ground on that day.

 >> He was not sick that day and it was not more one-half or three quarters of an hours' ride, with such fine horses and carriages as he had I went to the hiring ground as usual and asked my guardian if he could hire me out without putting me on the block; he said    yes.    
I asked him what he would take for me, and he said $50.Park Overby, a white friend of mine, said that he would give it; I was then safe, and Jones could not interfere with me.He intended to pay any sort of price for me, as he was going to have me at all hazaads.Fifty dollars in confederate money was nothing   it was God bearing me up.
I had two boys to be hired.I hired my buggy and horse and brought white men from Raleigh to hire my boys.Jones never had a chance to speak to me but once in two years, although he was there every other day and sometimes every day in the week.My daughter was still with me.

At the latter place I succeeded very well in passing my counterfeit gold and silver, particularly with the slaves, as they were unable to detect the difference.
In August I set out for New York.On reaching Buffalo, I diverged from my course and went to Toronto, in Canada.I there met the broker from Kingston with whom I had deposited the   100 note.Something had occurred to induce him to suspect me of wrong in it, and he accused me of it.I feigned not to know him or any thing of the transaction, and I stuck to it with such boldness that he finally concluded he was mistaken in the person.Not knowing how matters might stand on the way, I returned from Toronto to Rochester via Queenston, avoiding the direct rout.In about five weeks I left Rochester and went to Erie, and from thence to Pittsburg.
In November the River rose and I resolved to go to the West Indies by the way of New Orleans.I accordingly took a passage and went down.
 >> On arriving I determined to remain some time in New Orleans, and accordingly accepted a situation as waiter at the Planters' House.

 >> This was the first time I had been employed with slaves, and it was not long before a hostility sprung up between them and me.

 >> They succeeded in getting the steward on their side.
A difficulty occurred about some money which had been stolen from a guest.I was accused but there were no circumstances to justify it; but the Steward entering into it, succeeded in having me thrown into jail, on the suspicion of being a run-away slave.I had my papers with me, but they were informal in some respects, and I was compelled to send to New York to have them corrected.I found great difficulty in getting either the means of writing or of sending letters, after I had written I believe, and have seen nothing to change my belief, that my letters were purposely withheld by those who had me in custody; for after the elapse of a given term they would have had me sold to pay jail fees, when doubtless they expected to make a profit out of me.I prevailed on the keeper to put me in the chain gang, and whilst working on the street, fell in with persons who knew me and took the necessary steps to procure the evidence of my freedom.The servants at the Hotel or some one else took all my clothes and money, and when I was turned out in March, having been confined three months, I had neither a cent of money or a stitch of clothes, except what I had worn in prison, which it may readily be supposed were not very decent.I however, fell in with a white man who had known me in the North, and who gave me such clothes as rendered me decent.
Whilst I was in jail I became acquainted with Warrick.

## CONTEXT: 

By this time, the Spring had fully set in, it being about the 30th of 4th month, 1850, when the writer suffered severely in consequence of frosted limbs, which brought him to a true sense of his danger, as the burning and misery was so severe just below the knees, that he really thought that he should lose both legs.But praise be to God, he soon recovered.He here made up his mind to change his mode of travel, by sailing around from island to island, and in this manner he rested from such severe labour.Yet his mental powers were still feeble: he being advancing in years, he had little hope of an increase of strength thereof.
But here, in justice to his friends of Nantucket, though located on a small island, yet they certainly done their part, particularly the kind family with whom he put up, namely, A.W., who seeing that he was nearly destitute of comfortable clothing, did amply supply his wants, particularly with some of the best shirts that he ever had, and for which they, of course, have his thanks and prayers to God in their behalf until this day.Even so, amen.
Having left said island, he sailed next for Long Island, N.Y.Having arrived at Jamaica, he next proceeded to Jericho, where he concluded to remain and reckon up all his books, and so prepare to make his sixth and final Report of his stewardship, that he might be prepared to rest on the seventh year from all his labors.He found the amount collected to be $1375, and in order to make it even $1400, he gave the meeting of Friends at this place a call, and in a day or two, by divine aid, the object was accomplished, and a few cents over.Praise God, ye saints, for in this, has not the battle of the Lord been truly fought, and the victory won, and the long desired object attained at last.
 >> Hence, what remains but to praise the Lord, as in the noted cases of his servants of old, even King David, the son and stem of Jesse, when upon taking up the ark of the covenant from Shiloh up to Jerusalem, the chosen city of the most high God, yea, the God of Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Aaron, Joshua, Caleb, Samson, Sarah, Rebecca, Hannah, Samuel, Elijah, Elisha, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekial, Paul, Peter, James and John, yea, and of the thousands and tens of thousands of his saints, who by faith in God, through Christ Jesus our Lord, conquered all earth and hell, and are now seated at God's right hand.

 >> In attest of the same the writer here sets his seal this 3rd day of 1st month, A.D. 1861, and of the World, 5865.

 >> MAJOR JAMES WILKERSON,Of New Orleans, La., Author of the Midnight Cry.
A Virginian by birth, born not far from Little York, a town of no little renown, and as to his blood, he is of the Bengal of Africa, Anglo- Saxon of Europe, Powhatton of America; but strictly the grandson of Col.Wilkerson, who fought with one of the bravest of the brave, namely General Gates, at the battle of Saratoga, N.Y.
And now, after some several weeks of delightful rest of body and mind, it being well on to the 1st of 9th month, and time that he should make his return to the Conference, that met about the 20th of the same, he took his leave of said meetings of Friends, yea, and so bade adieu to this ever memorable place of repose, but not until he had first emptied his soul, as it were, of the very last blessing upon said meeting of Friends, and others thereabouts, who did so kindly entertain the writer, a stranger and pilgrim among them.
Hence, he having left said island, he sailed for New York City, where he had all of his checks duly attested by his worthy friend, I.T.H., he having examined them all carefully, according to the very latest Bank Detector, and so made his returns of the amount collected in cash, $1060, besides a land warrant claiming 160 acres, the land warrant being the writer's, and upon which land he truly intended to have established an Auxiliary to the Union Seminary, at some future period, thinking that he might be the means of providing a shelter for the fatherless, and so meet the saying of St. James, as before named.But in this he was disappointed, as will be seen in the conclusion.So we proceed by saying, that all said amount and land warrant were duly received by said Treasurer, as his books will show.Even so; so far so good.
This being settled, he now concluded, in order to improve his health, that he would embark for Matanzas or Havana, Cuba, and from thence on to Kingston, Jamaica, and then to Chagres, Central America, where he had purposed to spend the ensuing Winter with an old friend of his, namely, Joseph Prince, and for him to have acted as recording clerk, for $100 per month and found, he having received information to that effect by a particular friend.But in this quite cheering expectation he was sadly disappointed, from the very fact, that he having purchased the land warrant out of his quota due him for services, and besides, he went on $128 of the remainder to make up the sum of $1060, as before stated; and further, having purchased for himself a suitable coat to travel in; so when he arrived at Havana, and met all the necessary expenses there, he found that he actually had not enough funds left him to get as far as Kingston, Jamaica.

I went out to see how the storm was and found it very bad and growing worse.We immediately made preparations to go home.I soon had the horses hitched to the sleigh and driving up to the house my wife took a seat beside me.There was plenty of straw in the bottom of the sleigh and we had three or four blankets.Mr. Hackett asked if I thought we would have any trouble in getting home.I told him that I did not anticipate any trouble, as the tracks made by the sleigh when we came over were yet visible.We bade them goodbye,and started the horses off just as fast as they could go.
It was one o'clock in the afternoon when we started, and before we had gone far we discovered that we were in a terrible storm.Soon we lost sight of the sleigh tracks.For a time we kept on as we supposed straight ahead, but at last I stopped the horses, and said to my wife that we were lost.
 >> She thought not.

 >> The heavy storm and black clouds made it so dark that we could scarcely see each other sitting as close as we were.

 >> My wife then suggested that the horses be started and allowed to take their own way.
After we had thus wandered around for some time I said that I did not think we were far from home, but she thought we were three or four miles away.Again the horses were allowed to take their own course, but after they had walked for some time I stopped them and getting out of the sleigh walked a few steps ahead of the horses and found a place where the snow had been blown away and the ground left bare.It was where some one had cut hay, and I thought I could recognize it.I climbed into the sleigh and started the horses.They were soon plunging through a terrible big snow drift which they finally pulled through and were again on the level plain.Then I stopped them again, and said the Lord would have to deliver us from this storm.Wife said she was praying for deliverance.I started the horses again.

I toted bricks for him all day, which is something I never did before; but, as it is, I can get you seventy-five cents a day.   
So I went back the next day, and I continued to work for him a long time.He became very much attached to me, until one day one of his men, by the name of George, got mad with me because he saw that his master thought more of me than he would like, and therefore he threw a brick at my head; but I dodged it, and it passed over my head; but if it had hit me, it would have killed me dead.Wherefore I went and told my master about it, and he did not hesitate in coming to see about it; and when he got there, Mr. Wilson met him.    Are you Dr. Anderson?    he asked    Yes,    said master;    and where is that fellow that threw a brick at my boy?I just want to put my eyes on him, and he will never throw another brick again.    But Mr. Wilson spoke to him very kindly, and told him that he should be punished for it, and so he was.Then master wanted to take me along with him home, but Mr. Wilson told him that he thought a great deal of his boy, and asked to let him stay; and so the doctor did not take me away, and I got along finely with them all after that.
My master staid in Macon one year, then he went back again to Liberty county, to stay with his mother and friends.
 >> But as I anticipated marrying, he would not separate me from my wife.

 >> He left me in Macon, with the understanding that I should pay him twenty dollars a month.

 >> I agreed to do so.
Just before he left I got him to write me a recommendation to the lady in whose family I expected to lodge, and he did so with the greatest of pleasure, and it was received with delight, and that gave me a name in that family, which was Mrs. Sarah Usher; and the lady that I married is named Maria We were married the first Sunday in March, 1839.I got married when I was about twenty years of age, and my wife about thirty years of age.We have been married up to this date, the 22d of February, 1882, forty-three years.She has been a member of the church for forty-four years, and I have been a member up to date, forty-three years; and now that I have taken a wife, what next?
The next thing that presented itself to my mind was to remember the promises that I made to the good Lord when I was but a boy, and that is, I promised that if the good Lord would spare my life until I became a man, then I would serve the Lord; and that promise came to mind just shortly after I got married.I thought when I was a boy that man could not be a successful Christian unless he had a wife.That was my belief, and therefore I made that promise to the good Lord; and so I commenced visiting the church.
I went to the Methodist Church sometimes with my wife, as she was a member of it.

I must wait mine appointed time.
MICELLANEOUS VERSES, OR Reflections on the State of my mind during my first Convictions; of the Necessity of believing the Truth, and experiencing the inestimable Benefits of Christianity.


WELL may I say my life has been
One scene of sorrow and of pain;
From early days I griefs have known,
And as I grew my griefs have grown:


Dangers were always in my path;
And fear of wrath, and sometimes death;
While pale dejection in me reign'd
I often wept, by grief constrain'd.


When taken from my native land,
By an unjust and cruel band,
How did uncommon dread prevail!
My sighs no more I could conceal.


To ease my mind I often strove,
And tried my trouble to remove:
I sung, and utter'd sighs between   
Assay'd to stifle guilt with sin.


   But O! not all that I could do
Would stop the current of my woe;
Conviction still my vileness shew'd;
How great my guilt   how lost from God!


Prevented, that I could not die,
Nor might to one kind refuge fly;
An orphan state I had to mourn,   
Forsook by all, and left forlorn.   


Those who beheld my downcast mien
Could not guess at my woes unseen:
They by appearance could not know
The troubles that I waded through.


   Lust, anger, blasphemy, and pride,
With legions of such ills beside,
Troubled my thoughts,    while doubts and fears
Clouded and darken'd most my years.


   
 >> Sighs now no more would be confin'd   They breath'd the trouble of my mind:I wish'd for death, but check'd the word,And often pray'd unto the Lord.   

 >> Unhappy, more than some on earth,I thought the place that gave me birth   Strange thoughts oppress'd   while I replied   Why not in Ethiopia died?   

 >> And why thus spared, nigh to hell?   
God only knew   I could not tell!
   A tott'ring fence, a bowing wall,   
   I thought myself ere since the fall.   


   Oft times I mused, nigh despair,
While birds melodious fill'd the air:
Thrice happy songsters, ever free,
How bless'd were they compar'd to me!   


Thus all things added to my pain,
While grief compell'd me to complain;
When fable clouds began to rise
My mind grew darker than the skies.


The English nation call'd to leave,
How did my breast with sorrows heave!
I long'd for rest   cried    Help me, Lord!
Some mitigation, Lord, afford!

## CONTEXT: 

Such were the provisions for the daily toil of the slave.
Notwithstanding this system of management, however, I grew to be a robust and vigorous lad, and at fifteen years of age, there were few who could compete with me in work, or in sport   for not even the condition of a slave can altogether repress the animal spirits of the young negro.I was competent to all the work that was done upon the farm, and could run faster and farther, wrestle longer, and jump higher, than anybody about me.My master and my fellow slaves used to look upon me, and speak of me, as a wonderfully smart fellow, and prophecy the great things I should do when I became a man.A casual word of this sort, sometimes overheard, would fill me with a pride and ambition which some would think impossible in a negro slave, degraded, starved, and abused as I was, and had been, from my earliest recollection.But the love of superiority is not confined to kings and emperors; and it is a positive fact, that pride and ambition were as active in my soul as probably they ever were in that of the greatest soldier or statesman.The objects I pursued, I must admit, were not just the same as theirs.Mine were to be first in the field, whether we were hoeing, mowing, or reaping; to surpass those of my own age, or indeed any age, in athletic exercises; and to obtain, if possible, the favorable regard of the petty despot who ruled over us.This last was an exercise of the understanding, rather than of the affections; and I was guided in it more by what I supposed would be effectual, than by a nice judgment of the propriety of the means I used.
I obtained great influence with my companions, as well by the superiority I showed in labor and in sport, as by the assistance I yielded them, and the favors I conferred upon them, from impulses which I cannot consider as wrong, though it was necessary for me to conceal sometimes the act as well as its motive.
 >> I have toiled, and induced others to toil, many an extra hour, in order to show my master what an excellent day's work had been accomplished, and to win a kind word, or a benevolent deed from his callous heart.

 >> In general, indifference, or a cool calculation of my value to him, were my reward, chilling those hopes of an improvement in my condition, which was the ultimate object of my efforts.

 >> I was much more easily moved to compassion and sympathy than he was; and one of the means I took to gain the good-will of my fellow sufferers, was by taking from him some things that he did not give, in part payment of my extra labor.
The condition of the male slave is bad enough, Heaven knows; but that of the female, compelled to perform unfit labor, sick, suffering, and bearing the burdens of her own sex unpitied and unaided, as well as the toils which belong to the other, has often oppressed me with a load of sympathy.And sometimes, when I have seen them starved, and miserable, and unable to help themselves, I have helped them to some of the comforts which they were denied by him who owned them, and which my companions had not the wit or the daring to procure.Meat was not a part of our regular food; but my master had plenty of sheep and pigs, and sometimes I have picked out the best one I could find in the flock, or the drove, carried it a mile or two into the woods, slaughtered it, cut it up, and distributed it among the poor creatures, to whom it was at once food, luxury, and medicine.Was this wrong?I can only say that, at this distance of time, my conscience does not reproach me for it, and that then I esteemed it among the best of my deeds.
By means of the influence thus acquired, the increased amount of work done upon the farm, and by the detection of the knavery of the overseer, who plundered his employer for more selfish ends, and through my watchfulness was caught in the act and dismissed, I was promoted to be superintendent of the farm work, and managed to raise more than double the crops, with more cheerful and willing labor, than was ever seen on the estate before.
Previous to my attaining this important station, however, an incident occurred of so powerful an influence on my intellectual development, my prospect of improvement in character, as well as condition, my chance of religious culture, and in short, on my whole nature, body and soul, that it deserves especial notice and commemoration.There was a person living at Georgetown, a few miles only from R's plantation, whose business was that of a baker, and whose character was that of an upright, benevolent, Christian man.

## CONTEXT: 

Now all these bodies undergo a fermentation, are digested, and assist in forming other bodies; and were we (v. 2) to receive again the old bodies thus crumbled into the dust, at the resurrection, as they must first be made up new bodies, it would be a contradiction in itself to call them old.To collect the shattered pieces of an old building and put them up in the form of a building, would be putting up a new house, although the materials were from an old one.Are we not told that we must put off the old man and put on the new man, which, after God, is created in righteousness and true holiness?Eph. chap.4.The best thing we can say of this house of earth is, that it is a ruinous building, and will not be long before it tumbles into dust; that it is not our home, we look for another house eternal in the heavens.As our bodies shall return to their mother earth, it cannot possibly make any difference to us whether the bodies which we shall be clothed with on the last day, are made of the same old materials, or of its kindred earth, or of the new earth, which shall be made at that time, as it cannot add any thing to the glory and happiness of our souls or bodies.Neither has it been revealed to us whether the resurrection is to take place before the earth is burnt up, or at the time, or at the forming of the new earth.I therefore think it labor lost, for ministers of the Gospel to occupy too much of their time, as some do, in describing the ability of God to search out and collect these millions of millions of old shattered bodies, and restore them again to their several owners.This difficulty must only tend to puzzle the minds of their hearers, and raise doubts in their minds, and thereby shake their faith respecting the truth of other passages of Scripture which would be far better for them to understand.
 >> We know that there are many passages of Scripture which cannot be well understood in their literal meaning, and are only typical, and intended to rouse our minds up to understand that something extraordinary will take place, or must be done.

 >> Our blessed Lord has ordered that the souls of men, at the last day, shall again be clothed with bodies as at first, for a wise purpose.

 >> For what can that be?
Why, undoubtedly, to increase the glory and happiness of the saints, and also to swell the torments of the damned.St. Peter in his 2d epistle, 3d chap., tells us that we are to look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.May we not then conclude from this, that this new earth will become a new garden of Eden, and will be peopled with saints?Such men, for instance, as Adam was before his fall; and, as in that case, they will need bodies as at first, and perhaps can as fully enjoy themselves in this new garden, as Adam did in the old one.O! would it not be the heigth of wisdom for us to secure to ourselves this happiness?Certainly our salvation is a matter of too much importance to be neglected; our life too uncertain to admit of delay; aud our souls too precious to run the hazard of losing them.Had we many souls we might venture the loss of one, but seeing that we have but one only, and that if it be lost, all the riches and treasures of the world cannot redeem it, we should watch day and night for its preservation.

Often would he point the mind with such clearness to the joys prepared for the faithful; to the golden streets; the jasper walls; the roses of paradise; the Tree of Life; the crown of glory; the drinking from the crystal stream; the beholding the Father, Son and Holy Spirit! till the humble believer could say I will arise and hasten to the feast of the Lamb, and partake in the joys of that blest world!
This Circuit will long remember the many heart-cheering sermons they have heard fall from his lips from time to time.And although his voice is hushed in the silence of death, yet in the memory of many of his hearers he is yet alive.This year passed with its joys and conflicts, and although nothing extraordinary transpired, it was a year of peace and assurance to the souls of his hearers.
CHAPTER XVII.
His return to the Washington Circuit, and eleventh year's labor.
In 1845 we were favored to journey up together again to Conference at Columbus, O., and as on former occasions, we passed a pleasant time during this tour.After passing ten day's close application, the session closed; and at brother Davis' request, we started with him to visit his aged parents in Shelby Co., O., after two days' travelling, about 43 miles a day, we arrived at the house of his dear friends.
In a humble cottage in the midst of a heavy timbered country, lived this aged couple.I shall never forget the hour we entered the premises of this venerable family, crossing a field we came to the house of one of his brother's, and a little boy saluted him with    is not that uncle Fayette.    
 >> Here we stopped a short time, and then moved on to the next house.

 >> The shades of night was just wrapping nature in her nocturnal silence.

 >> All was quietness, but now and then the voice of the owl was heard to sound through the lofty oaks of the forest.
We saw an elderly lady coming out to meet us, when brother D. requested me to move on first, and see whether his mother would know him or not.And as I drew near, the old lady gave me her hand and I introduced myself to her.She looked at her son but could not make him out, till the tenderness of a son's heart could no longer refrain from the expression of love to a tender parent; he spoke and his mother recognized him.What joy was in that house! when the long absent son had come, and returned to the bosom of a loving father and mother!Although it never had been my lot to see them before, yet the kindness of the family made me feel myself at home.
The old gentleman said he was at least 103 years old; he was cheerful and lively, and on Sabbath he walked to Church in company with us, and from the pleasure of seeing his son, said he almost felt like a young man.The neighborhood all came out, and we had a fine time; the Lord was present and that to comfort his people.We had service twice that day, and all returned to their homes.

   We are going to build a church at Forrest City, and will use these bricks for the front.

 >> Uncle Scott this is very nice in you and we thank you for your kindness.   
This was the first sale of brick I made at the kiln.Within the next day or two, I met Mrs. Graham, who was a large land owner and a Christian lady.I said to her,    I see you are making extensive improvements on your farms.I see you are hauling brick from Forrest City to build your chimneys.Now as we are neighbors and own large farms adjoining, I would be glad for you to have your agents examine my brick kiln and if the brick and prices meet your approval, I would like to supply you with them.   
   Why Uncle Scott, have you a brick kiln and what do you ask for your brick?   
   $9.50 per M.   
   All right, I will instruct my agent to get the balance of the brick I need from you.   
A day or so later, there were seven wagons from Mrs. Graham's at the kiln for brick.The wagons continued to haul until they had hauled off the last brick I had to spare.

## CONTEXT: 

Sometimes master would hire a white man who did nothing else but hunt runaway slaves for a living, this man would take from fifteen to twenty hounds with him to hunt Monday but often he would be out three or four months, when he was caught and brought home he was put in prison and was whipped every day for a week or two, but just as soon as he could he would run away again.
At one time when he was away and was brought home, one of his arms was tied and he was put in care of a keeper who made him work with the other slaves days, and put him in confinement nights, but for all this he got away from his keeper and went into the woods again.The last time he ran away two white men were hired to hunt him, they had about twenty-five blood hounds, but this time Monday fell in with another slave who had run away from his master and been in the woods seven years and they together were able to kill a greater portion of the hounds.Finally, the white men caught his companion, but did not catch Monday, though they chased him two or three days longer, but he came home himself, they did not whip him and he went to work in the field.Things went on very nicely with him for two or three weeks, until one day a white man was seen riding through the field with the overseer, of course the slaves did not mistrust his object as white men often visited master's plantation, but that night when all the slaves were sleeping, the man that was seen in the daytime went to the door of Monday's cabin and called him out of his bed, and when he came to his door the stranger whom he had never seen before that day, handcuffed him and said    You now belong to me.    Most of the slaves found it out, as Monday was put into a cart and carried through the streets of the negro quarters, and there was quite an excitement, but Monday was never heard from again.
THE STORY OF JAMES HAY.
There was a slave named Jim Hay, who belonged to a neighbor of master's, he was a field hand and was punished a great many times because he could not get his task done.The other slaves pitied him because he seemed unable to perform his task.One evening he got a severe whipping, the next morning as the slaves were having their tasks assigned them an old lady by the name of Aunt Patience went by, and said,    never mind, Jim, my son, the Lord will help you with your task to-day,    he answered,    yes ma'am.
 >> He began his work very faithfully and continued until it was half done, then he lay down under a tree, the others not understanding his motive thought he was tired and was taking a rest, but he did not return to his task until the overseer called him and asked him why he did not have his work nearer done, he said,    Aunt Patience told me dis morning that the Lord would help me to-day, and I thought as I did half of the task, the Lord might have finished the other half if he intended to help me at all.    

 >> The overseer said    you see that the Lord did not come to help you and we shall not wait for him, but we will help you;    so Jim got a severe punishment.

 >> Sometime after this, Jim Hay was called upon by some professors of religion, they asked him if he was not tired of serving the devil and told him that the Lord was good and had helped many of his people and would help all who asked him and then take them home to heaven.
Jim said that if the Lord would not do half an acre of his task for him when he depended on him, he did not think he could trust him, and Jim never became a Christian to my knowledge.
THE STORY OF MR. USOM AND JACK.
One Sunday when we boys were at the overseer's, Mr. Usom's house, as we generally were, he said to one,    Jack, don't you think that Hell is a very hot place, if it is as they describe it?    Jack said,    yes massa.    Mr. Usom said,    well, how do you think it will be with poor fellows who have to go there?       well, Massa Bob, I tell you what I tinks about it, I tink us niggers need not trouble usselves about hell as the white folks.    How is that, Jack?    Jack answered    because us niggers have to work out in the hot sun and if us go to hell, it would not be so bad for us because us used to heat, but it will be bad for white folks because they is not used to hot weather.

## CONTEXT: 

Man as important in prompting and stimulating him to do his best needs that enlarged vision and quickening inspiration that come from a well-trained, capacious and a well-stored mind with living, uplifting truths.
But morality or the moral life must be watched and molded with great care and fervent prayer, for the moral life is a round higher in the ladder of human development, human progress.Says one,    Morality is the vestibule of religion.       Morality is essential to good government.       What can laws do without morals?    Says Dr. Horace Mann,    Ten men have failed from defect in morals where one has failed from defect in intellect.    Without enlightening the conscience and strengthening the moral sense and moral obligation you can't become good brothers and sisters, good companions, good teachers, good neighbors, good husbands and wives, good fathers and mothers, good citizens.
This brings us to consider the spiritual life, the Christian religious life, which forms the climax of human development, advance and progress.While it is the duty of each both in the morning and evening of the day and of life to watch and guard and preserve and develop the health of the body, to cultivate, enlarge and enrich the mind and to enlighten and strengthen the moral sense, yet it is the spiritual life that brings us into the family of God, links us with all that is brightest and best in eternity.
It is here man's first and highest duties lie.    
 >> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy might.       

 >> And thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.       

 >> Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,    and we have the promise that all necessary temporal blessings shall be added.   
Bodily exercise profiteth little, but Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.       Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth.   
   Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.    It is by belief in Jesus as the Son of God that one is born unto the Kingdom of God and comes into possession of spiritual life and has communion and fellowship with the triune God and His loyal, faithful servants and is prepared to sow the good seed of which Jesus spoke that fell into good ground and brought forth some an hundred fold.

I wish I could tell them of my love   if only they would not visit their vengeance upon you   tell them of the sweetness of its taste.Perhaps, then, when I am dishonored, they would not try to take me from you then, and with even this milk-eyed Lavasser, all reeking himself with pollution, to scorn me, I could still be yours.Oh, how I would bless him for his scorn   for Paul, I had rather be your   your   yes, I will speak it in its vilest sense   I had rather be your mistress than to be his wife.   
* * * * * * * * *
But daylight brought its moments of rational meditatation, as well as its lethe to passion, and in the hours of sad but calm reflection which followed, my young mistress foresaw the utter fatuity of even the most stubborn resistance to the expressed wishes of her parents.She saw as clearly then as I had seen before that resistance would only augment her own misery and shame, and reluctantly, though she did, she confided to me fully her resignation to what under the circumstances we both regarded as inevitable.
   Oh, Paul, I fear that I was very wicked last night   sinful and mean, but I was so desperate.It seemed so horrible   the idea of marrying any other man but you   of marrying such a man as Eugene Lavasser, while loving such a man as you   you, Paul.But I have thought it all over all morning, and for your own sake, Paul, as well as mine, and because you ask it of me, and because you think it best, I will do it.I know now that you do love me truly   better than I love my own self   and that it is for this you think it best that I should marry that man, who comes between us.I can trust you, Paul, in all things, and I will trust you in this
 >> . I will marry Eugene Lavasser, but it will only be with my lips, my heart will not speak the vow, for I shall never cease to love you, never, never.

 >> I shall hold you first in my heart, and shall think it no sin to have you near me.

 >> If I sin at all it will be against you in marrying him, and not against Eugene Lavasser in still loving you.
Now, Paul, can you forgive me for the sin against you, and will you promise to love me none the less if I marry him?   
   Oh darling, you make me very happy.There is nothing that can ever efface your image from my heart, or lessen the measure of my love,    I said, softly kissing her.
The next day young Lavasser came, and the espousals were ratified by the ring and the kiss, the brilliancy of the ring compensating, perhaps, for the coldness of the kiss.
And so they were married, in all the splendor of wealth and of fashion, and no fairer bride was ever seen, her blushing reserve and almost sad drawing back being accredited to a shy, maidenly modesty.And I!I looked on from afar off with a heart as heavy as lead and almost as dead.
I knew it was best for us both that we did not meet or try to speak, and so all the evening I kept as far away as my duties would permit me.

I thereupon established myself in the room, where I write this portion of my history.
After a short rest I went in search of the parsonage of the Methodist E. Church, and found the pastor at home.After a brief conversation with him, he signed his name to my appeal book for one of my books.I did not give it to him as I did a brother in the city where I just came from, and let him have the chance to read it through, and then return it, saying that he was not able to purchase it.The brother I have reference to resides in Philadelphia.This action of mine learned me a lesson to never be too friendly to a man simply because he is a preacher.Some of them have deceived me, and I am determined not to be caught napping again, and so I did not give my brother the chance to treat me in a like manner   no pay, no book.
He requested me to go on an excursion with him and his Sunday School.

R Anderson.I must confess I appreciated it very highly.The day has been spent in peace and pleasure.
I hope to meet with success in this city, which is the largest I ever visited in all my life.
This morning I went to the postoffice and sent $40.00 to J. W. Burke & Co., Macon, Ga., to pay for the books he had sent me.

Religion and humanity enjoin me this day to give thee thy liberty, and justice requires me to pay thee for eight years and a half service, at the rate of twenty-one pounds five shillings per annum, including in it thy food and raiment, making altogether a sum of ninety-five pounds twelve shillings and six pence owing to thee; but as thou art young and healthy, thou hadst better work for thy living: my intention is to give thee a bond for it, bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent.
3.    Thou hast now no master but God and the laws   go into the next room, thou wilt find there thy late mistress and my nephew; they are engaged in writing thy manumission.May God bless thee, James!Be wise and industrious; in all thy trials, thou wilt find a friend in thy old master.   
4.James, surprised at a scene so new and affecting, shed many tears: astonishment, gratitude, and a variety of feelings, shook his frame.He shed a flood of tears, and could scarcely articulate these words:    Ah! my master, why do you give me my liberty?I have always had what I wanted: we have worked together in the fields, and I have worked as much for myself as for you.I have eaten of the same food, and been clothed like you   and we have gone together on foot to meeting: we have the Sabbath to ourselves: we don't lack any thing.When we are sick, our good and tender mistress comes to our bed-side, always saying something consolatory to us.

 >> Ah!

 >> my dear master, when I am free, where shall I go? and when I am sick?         
Thou shalt be as the whites; thou shalt hire with those who will give thee generous wages: in a few years, thou shalt purchase a piece of land, marry a wife, wise and industrious as thyself, and rear up children, as I have reared thee, in the fear of the Lord and love of labour.After having lived free and happy, thou shalt die in peace.Thou must accept liberty, James, it is a great while since it was due to thee.Would to God, the Father of all men, that the whites had never thought of trading in thy African brethren: may He inspire all men with the desire of following our example.We, who regard Liberty as the first of our blessings, why should we refuse it to those who live amongst us?   
6.    Ah!my master, you are so good is the reason; I wish not to leave you   I have never been a slave.You have never spoken to me but as you speak to white men: I have lacked nothing, either in sickness or in health: I have never worked more than your neighbours, who have worked for themselves: I have been richer than many whites, to some of whom I have lent money: and my good and tender mistress never commands us to do any thing, but makes us do every thing by only saying,    Please to do it.

## CONTEXT: 

Where have you been?    said he.Poor Lydia now burst into tears, and said,    I only stopped to talk awhile to this man,    pointing to me;    but, indeed, master overseer, I will never, do so again.       Lie down,    was his reply.Lydia immediately fell prostrate upon the ground and in this position he compelled her to remove her old tow linen shift, the only garment she wore, so as to expose her hips, when he gave her ten lashes, with his long whip, every touch of which brought blood, and a shriek from the sufferer.He then ordered her to go and get her supper, with an injunction never to stay behind again.The other three culprits were then put upon their trial.
The first was a middle aged woman, who had, as her overseer said, left several hills of cotton in the course of the day, without cleaning and hilling them in a proper manner.She received twelve lashes.The other two were charged in general terms, with having been lazy, and of having neglected their work that day.Each of these received twelve lashes.

 >> These people all received punishment in the same manner that it had been inflicted upon Lydia, and when they were all gone, the overseer turned to me and said      Boy, you are a stranger here yet, but I called you in, to let you see how things are done here, and to give you a little advice.

 >> When I get a new negro under my command, I never whip at first; I always give him a few days to learn his duty, unless he is an outrageous villain, in which case I anoint him a little at the beginning.

 >> I call over the names of all the hands twice every week, on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, and settle with them according to their general conduct, for the last three days.
I call the names of my captains every morning, and it is their business to see that they have all their hands in their proper places.You ought not to have staid behind to-night with Lyd; but as this is your first offence, I shall overlook it, and you may go and get your supper.    I made a low bow, and thanked master overseer for his kindness to me, and left him.This night for supper, we had corn bread and cucumbers; but we had neither salt, vinegar, nor pepper, with the cucumbers.
I had never before seen people flogged in the way our overseer flogged his people.This plan of making the person who is to be whipped, lie down upon the ground, was new to me, though it is much practised in the south; and I have since seen men and women too, cut nearly in pieces by this mode, of punishment.It has one advantage over tying people up by the hands, as it prevents all accidents from sprains in the thumbs or wrists.I have known people to hurt their joints very much, by struggling when tied up by the thumbs, or wrists, to undergo a severe whipping.

In spite of his years and his infirmities, poor Solomon managed to find his way to the Cincinatti hotel; where he was earning his bread like an honest man, by cleaning shoes, and making himself useful about the house; when his owner, finding he had still a few dollars worth of labour left in him, sent his brother-in-law to bring him back.Outraged humanity, however, at last asserted her rights   the indignation of the by-standers protected the old man's grey hairs.He was subsequently rescued by the benevolence of one of his own race, who provided him a comfortable home in his declining years.His benefactor, who had realized five or six thousand dollars by his industry, to which he was indebted for his own freedom industry, had laid out part of his savings in procuring that blessing for others.He had redeemed a young woman from servitude for three hundred, and a man for six hundred, dollars.
   As the poor old man expressed himself very indistinctly the mistress of the house interpreted what he said.
 >> An anecdote she had frequently heard from him, and which she related to us, while he sat by enjoying the general laugh it created, shewed what cunning and self-possession the slaves have.

 >> She had before told us a very amusing story of a lad who acted the part of Brutus so successfully, that, while his master set him down for an idiot, he had completed his preparations for a long journey and started 'one fine day' with his saddle-bags well filled and a trusty steed, for Canada; with the route to which he had made himself thoroughly acquainted, by asking one of the sons to explain the queer dots and lines on the map.

 >> He changed horses regularly as he proceeded, wherever he could do so with safety, and dismissed them in succession, to find their way home.
In this manner he arrived at the place    where he would be,    and is now a good loyal British subject; while his master is vowing vengeance, and literally growing twigs to scourge rebellious boy   when he gets him again into his power; his forgiveness of a former flight, occasioned by his brutality, having, he declares, encouraged a second attempt.   
But we must not forget    Uncle Solomon    and his joke.    He was one Sunday at a neighbour's house, when the mistress returned from church, and not finding the dinner ready began to scold the cook in no measured terms.    Madam,   ' said the woman,    you gave me no orders; and you know you have always told me to do nothing without orders.       True,    replied the mistress,    but your conscience might have told you that I was not to be starved.    The cook put on a look of stupidity.    What!don't you understand me?    exclaimed the virago,    don't you understand what conscience is?

## CONTEXT: 

We found her indeed a very remarkable woman, though it is probable there are many remarkable woman among the despised slaves as amiable and accomplished as herself.Such, at least, was the account she gave us of their condition, that we felt convinced of the superiority possessed by many in moral worth and intellectual acuteness above their oppressors.She confirmed everything I had heard from others with regard to the characters of the slaves.She never knew one who did not long for freedom, or who felt contented with his lot.Many have taught themselves reading and writing, having acquired the requisite knowledge with astonishing rapidity.All are alive to the injustice done them; some will rather suffer death than be separated from the objects of their affection.Their firmness is so well known, that a resolution to this effect when once pronounced, will deter any one at a sale from purchasing them separately.
   Christiana had not forgotten that she had royal blood in her veins, and she shewed herself worthy of the distinction it implied, by her willingness to engage in any work that did not carry moral degradation with it.If I might judge from the tenor of her conversation, her hand and heart were never at fault, when danger or distress called for the exertion of either.She had a strong sense of religion, and the violation of its injunctions she had been so long doomed to witness in others, had taught her the necessity and value of practical attention to its duties.
 >> Her brother, who had come to Philadelphia under a promise to return to his owner, had informed her of his intention to obtain his freedom by breaking his engagement. '

 >> If he does so,' said she 'he shall never enter my house again; whatever may be his wrongs, his honour ought not to be forfeited.'

 >> This feeling is so general and so well understood, that masters often allow their slaves to go into other states upon their promising not to abscond.   
Some beautiful instances of the power of Divine grace, working upon the heart of the native Negro, are related by Miss Tucker, in her interesting volume, very appropriately entitled    Sunrise within the Tropics.    Truly the light of the gospel has now broken forth on a continent long under darkness and eclipse. Amongst the most interesting of these cases,I condense the following:   
Adjai, a boy of twelve years old, along with his mother and sisters, was bound in , chains, and sold into slavery.After suffering very greatly, being several times sold and resold, dragged from place to place, and enduring almost intolerable hardships and sorrows, Adjai was shipped, in 1822, with one hundred and eighty-seven unfortunate companions, on board a Portuguese slaver at Lagos, where the treatment he met with corresponded but too well with the frightful accounts detailed in the Parliamentary Papers.Happily it was but of short duration; for, on the very next evening, by God's good providence, the slaver fell in with two English cruisers, and was captured by them.The poor captives were now in greater despair than before, for the Portuguese had succeeded in making these simple-hearted people believe that the English thus watched for and seized the Slave ships, that they might use the blood of the Negroes to dye their scarlet cloth, and their flesh as baits for cowries.
Adjai and a few other boys were taken on board one of the English ships.But here their terror was wound up to its highest pitch, by seeing a number of cannon-balls piled upon the deck, which they took for the heads of some of their companions; while they concluded that some joints of pork hanging up to dry were their limbs.

She had a kind master, and her boys were near her, as was also Uncle Moses, the husband of her latter years.Of poor Silas, to whom her heart's young affections had been given, she never heard.He might be dead, and   oh!what torture in the thought!   he might be enduring sufferings compared with which, even death itself were naught.She could only pray for his weal; and trust, as she ever found it sweet to do, to that compassionate father, who loves the prayers of the humble, while    the proud he knoweth afar off.   
But it was concerning her daughter that Aunt Sally's spirit was most deeply troubled.She was so young to be taken away   and alone among strangers too   how often would she need her mother's sympathy and counsel!
   Well,    said she to Uncle Moses, at the close of one of their frequent conversations on the subject.    I's mighty glad de pore chile done got married, 'Pears like she wont be so lonesome now.I'd like to see her ole man.

There were at this time two sets of slaves on Mr. Peoples' place; his own, and those belonging to the estate of a deceased brother, with whom he had been in partnership.Many of these were united by family ties, and all were strongly attached to each other, as they had lived together for many years.
Suddenly, late in the autumn of 1827, the gloomy tidings came among them that they were to be separated.Their master, having heard tempting accounts of the beauty and fertility of Florida's fair plains, had determined to remove there with his working hands: while those belonging to his brother's estate, as well as the children and any that were unfit for labor, should remain on the home place, in the guardianship of an overseer.
Aunt Sally was overwhelmed with sorrow.

## CONTEXT: 

We went into the town, and were warmly welcomed by the brethren, and we had quite a laugh over the result of that day's journey to Roundout.
I told Elder Clark that I did not think I would ever forget the 18th day of February, and he said that he did not think he ever should.
On the 20th of February I crossed Detroit River into Michigan, and went from thence to Toledo, where I occupied the Sabbath in the service of the Lord.I then went to Perrysburg, Ohio and on the Sabbath I preached in the Methodist and Baptist churches.From thence I went to Sandusky City, where I arrived on Saturday evening.I found that some of the brethren had made a purchase of a meeting-house, and had only worshipped in it one Sabbath.
They were very glad to see me, for they had no supply for the next day (Sabbath).
I preached for them from the text:    I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.    After the meeting had dismissed, one of the brethren came to me and said   
   Are you the minister the Lord sent here?I am like Abraham of old: I find myself here with a few Baptists, and have bought this house, and we have been praying to the Lord to send us a minister, and we think that you are the man.   

 >> I told him that I was willing to do all the good I could while I was there.

 >> I preached for them again in the evening.

 >> They then asked me to hold a series of meetings.
They said that they wanted a revival, and had been praying that the Lord would send His Holy Spirit among them.
We began our meetings on Tuesday evening, and continued there during the week.The Lord blessed my labors, and on the Sabbath morning I had the pleasure of baptizing four humble converts.
There was one young lady and her sister-in-law who embraced religion.The husband of one of them was very much opposed to his wife and sister becoming religious.He would molest our meetings, and make sport of religious things.
I proposed to the church to pray for that young man's conversion.
The next Sabbath we held another baptism, and this young man attended.

## CONTEXT: 

In the evening the man came and conducted us to his house, where we found the men we had seen at the toll-gate in the morning.They were mostly armed with pistols and guns.They guided us to a solitary house three miles back among the mountains, in the neighborhood of which we remained three days.We were told to go up on the mountain very high, where was an Indian cave in the rocks.From this cave we could look a great distance around and see people, and we felt afraid they would see us.So instead of staying there, we went down the mountain to a creek where trees had been cut down and branches thrown over the bank; we went under the branches and bushes where the sand was dry, and there we would sit all day.We all the time talked to each other about how we would get away, and what we should do if the white folks tackled us; that was all our discourse.
We stayed there until Friday, when our friends gave us knapsacks full of cakes and dried venison, and a little bundle of provision besides, and flints and steel, and spunk, and a pocket-compass to travel through the woods by.We knew the north-star, but did not travel nights for nearly a week.So on Friday morning we set out, the men all bidding us good-by, and the man of the flag-staff went with us half a day to teach us the use of the compass; we had never seen one before.
 >> Once in a while he would put it on a log to show us how to travel by it.

 >> When he was leaving us, he took his knife and marked on the compass, so that we should steer a little west of north.

 >> During the six days succeeding, we traversed an unbroken wilderness of hills and mountains, seeing neither man nor habitation.
At night we made a fire to sit by.We saw deer on our way; we were not annoyed by wild animals, and saw but one snake, a garter-snake.The first sign of man we met with was a newly-made road; this was on the seventh day from the time we left the house in the mountains.Our provisions held out well, and we had found water enough.After crossing the road, we came out from the mountains to a level cleared place of farms and houses.Then we were afraid, and put ourselves on our guard, resolving to travel by night.We laid by until starlight, then we made for a road leading to the north.We would follow a road until it bent away from the north; then we would leave it and go by the compass.

## CONTEXT: 

The dogs, sharpened by extreme hunger, were no sooner let loose than they tore the poor wretch to pieces.The ranging animals disputed with each other the palpitating members, and the ground was dyed with human blood and canine foam.A report spread among the blacks, that, at the last groan of that pitiable creature, the heavens opened and received his soul.
This kind of death, with circumstances more or less frightful, became common, until cruelty, dispensing with all forms, disdainfully cast human beings to the dogs, who were kept in packs near the city; and when the appetite of the animals, satisfied with human flesh and gore, refused any longer to destroy, the sword finished the bloody work: showing that man's passions surpass in atrocity those of wild beasts.Indeed, language failed of terms to describe the crimes which the lust of unjust power perpetrated.New expressions were invented.The drowning of two or three hundred human beings was called    a good haul;    death on a gallows was    a step upward;    to be torn in pieces by dogs was    to enter the arena.    Some executioners gained celebrity; the name of Tombarel long continued to make men shudder.The sea and the rivers were stained with blood.The numbers of victims were so considerable that the inhabitants refused to eat fish, lest they should feed on blood of their own color.

 >> Many blacks, of whom some had witnessed these atrocities, and others, who, in the confusion, had, by swimming or flight, escaped from the hands of the executioners, went to join the ranks of the insurgents in different places.

 >> Often, under the shade of a tree, or under the point of a rock, these fugitives might be seen recounting to their companions the punishment they had witnessed, or suffered.

 >> How great soever the cruelty, it was exaggerated in their hyperbolical phraseology.
The crowd listened with intense curiosity, silence, and horror; often the narrators were interrupted by questions respecting the fate of a child, or a sister, who had died on the gibbet, or had been tossed into the sea.At these frightful accounts, the auditors shed tears, but they were tears of vengeance.Some shouted,    Shall we go down into our tombs without having avenged them?No! their bones would repulse ours.    Others, by gestures and cries, not satisfied with having carried fire and sword over the lowlands, stirred each other up to deeds of carnage and devastation.Vengeance of a certain barbaric grandeur burst forth.In listening to one of these narratives, Paul L'Ouverture, the brother of Toussaint, learned that, without any reason, his wife, who lived at the Cape, in the peace of her own home, had been drowned.

I said    Once, twice, three times and sold to Robert Clement for forty-five cents.    Mr. McGowan had his clerk there taking down the amount of cash of the articles being sold, as everything was sold for cash.No one had said anything as to who would pay for the saw.The clerk stepped up to my father and said,    You owe us forty-five cents for the saw.    My father said,    O, that saw belongs to my son.    I had told him to make the bid but had forgotten to give him the money which I should have done at the dinner table.The clerk tapped me on the foot with his pencil and said,    Mr. Auctioneer, you owe us forty-five cents.    I turned to my father and said    Have you no money to pay for this saw?    He said,    No, you knew that I had no money when you told me to bid the saw in at the dinner table.    I at once pulled a half doller from my pocket and said,    I will lend you a half dollar    and paid for the saw and gave me back five cents.
 >> In order to make my side as good as possible, I said to the clerk,    My father has bought the saw to saw up wood at the house.    

 >> My father answered and said,    My son, you need no saw for wood, you use coal.    

 >> I said to myself    Stung again,    and said no more.
The old gentleman was born in an honest country and had lived seventy-six years of an honest life, now when his sun was fairly spent in the Western horizon he could not afford to spot that life by shielding his son to obtain an old wood saw contrary to law.
In February, 1895, my brother John who was then working at S. C. Gill's of this city, conceived the idea that a fortune awaited him in the City of Chicago and all that was needed for him to do was to move there and get it.I earnestly prevailed on him that a smaller town was better to live in and he had lived here for three yars and had and would accumulate friends that he would not in Chicago.I told him he was a modest Christian gentleman and that kind of a character in a community like this would soon lift him into the hearts of the best people and he would soon become satisfied, but his being two years my senior, my persuasions were to no avail; he was determined to go to Chicago and to Chicago he went on February 15, 1895.He secured a position on the Pullman Palace cars that run out of Chicago to Galveston, Texas.The snow would be six inches deep when leaving Chicago and in twelve hours he would be where the cattle were grazing on green grass.He contracted a cold in his head and caused congestion of the brain, he was sick one year and died on April 31st, 1898, and I was left alone to hold up the original Clement blood.Sometime before his death there was born to him a little baby girl whose name is Arrellia Virtir Clement, the only living niece I have on earth; and I trust her path of life may be strewed with flowers and peace be to her father's ashes.

Grasping the tobacco with a    Hem, dat's mighty little, boy,    she tore off a fragment, dropped it into the skillet and tucked the remainder into a chink of the cabin.    An' whar's de wisky, boy?I can't do nuffin 'out de wisky, gal or no gal; an it's no fool job witchin' a wite nigger.I'll jis let 'er drap 'out you get de wisky.

Taking the bottle with the brightening of her bloodshot eyes, she exclaimed,    Dat's de kind, honey, as witches more nor 'lasses, nor grease, nor   ; yes, dat's de kind.   
Lifting the lid of the skillet, she poured into it a few drops of the liquid, and raising the bottle to her lips swallowed the contents in one draught.    Dat's de stuff as witches, honey; bring wisky, an' you can hab all de gals on de place.   
Hunting around, she found an old gourd and poured into it the composition, and handing it to William, proceeded to give instructions as to its use.

 >> Hurry up, you slow huffs, you Susan, 'fore Sam is plum dead.   

 >> It was Aunt Dorah standing in her cabin door, looking after Susan who was making slow progress toward the house, digging her bare toes into the soil, evidently more interested in the height to which she could throw sand with her feet, than in the execution of her errand.   

 >> Hurry up dar, or I'll gib you forty w'en you gits back.   
Knowing from experience that Aunt Dorah's threats were frequently carried into execution, the child proceeded on her way to deliver her message, and, discovering her mistress upon the gallery, addressed her:
   Aunt Dorah says, please ma'am, to come down to de quarters wi' de tuffentime, fur de colic's done broke out; Mandy's got de yellow febers, an' Sam's got suffin, an', an' dey all's heavin' up, dey is.   
Calls for any other remedy than quinine were seldom heard.Chills and fever were common, and lightly regarded; but other diseases rarely visited Mulberry Grove; hence, this announcement of sickness alarmed Mrs. Ninus, and, as soon as Letitia could procure the bottle of turpentine and the sugar bowl, they went down to the quarters.
Those who may be disposed to consider the lot of this lady with envy, having servants ready to do her bidding, know nothing of the responsibility of her position.Every garment was cut out by her, and made under her supervision.Whenever cases of sickness occurred, she was called in, and exercised her practical judgment, as a mother with a family.In cases of mechanical injury, her hands bound up the wounds, and directed the treatment.Upon her shoulders rested the care and responsibility of preserving the health of the rising generation of blacks, as well as that of her own husband and children.

## CONTEXT: 

Oh, slow tortures! in comparison to which that of Prometheus was very pleasure.There is no Tartarus like that of wounded, agonized domestic love!Far away from him, in a lonely cabin, he beheld his stricken wife and all his    pretty chickens    pining and unprotected.
Slowly, after a few days, he relapsed into that stony sort of despair that denies itself the gratification of speech.The change was very painfully visible to me, and I tried, by every artifice, to arouse him; but I had no power to wake him.

   Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak,
Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.   

And soon learning this, I left him, a remorseless prey to that    rooted sorrow    of the brain.

One day, as we all sat in the shed-room, engaged at our various occupations, we were roused by a noise of violent weeping, and something like a rude scuffle just without the door, when suddenly Atkins entered, dragging after him, with his hand close about his throat, a poor negro man, aged and worn, with a head white as cotton.
   Oh, please, Masser, jist let me go back, an' tell de ole 'ooman farewell, an' I won't ax for any more.   
   No, you old rascal, you wants to run away.
 >> If you say another word about the old woman, I'll beat the life out of you.      

 >> Oh lor', oh lor', do poor ole 'ooman an' de boys; oh my ole heart will bust!    and, sobbing like a child, the old man sank down upon the floor, in the most abandoned grief.   

 >> Here, boys, some of you git the fiddle and play, an' I warrant that old fool will be dancin' in a minnit,    said Atkins in his unfeeling way.
Of course this speech met with the most signal applause from    de boys    addressed.
I watched the expression of Charles' face.It was frightful.
He sat in one corner, as usual, with an open book in his hand.From it he raised his eyes, and, whilst the scene between Atkins and the old negro was going on, they flashed with an expression that I could not fathom.His brows knit, and his lip curled, yet he spoke no word.
When Atkins withdrew, the old man lay there, still weeping and sobbing piteously.I went up to him, kindly saying,
   What is the matter, old uncle?

Hearing the colored cotton-growers were to have a meeting that night, a few miles from the city, and being invited to attend, I embraced the opportunity.Some thirty persons were assembled, and as I entered the room, I heard them chanting   


Sing yo' praises! Bless de Lam!

## CONTEXT: 

He soon after bought a farm in Huntington, where he lived with three of his children.As his labors had been blessed in this place in the conversion of many, a church was organized in the fall, of the Free Will Baptist Order.
On the 26th of November of this year, the church in Huntington, of which he was a member, called a council to sit with them, to examine, and ordain brother Bowles to the work of the Gospel Ministry.The council consisted of Elders Webster and Maynard.This council, with the church, set him apart to the work whereto God had called him.His trials were severe, and often in his journeys, he knew not where to find a shelter.On one occasion, he started on a preaching tour   it was a cold, dreary winter's day; after riding through the day without food, for he was penniless, he began to think of supper, and shelter for the night; but where to go he knew not; he was far from home, and among strangers; but he sought Jacob's God, and like him, prayed that God would direct him to some friendly abode.What an object for the protecting care of Him, without whose knowledge, not even a sparrow can fall to the ground! that dark son of Africa, kneeling behind his cutter, upon the cold snow, imploring the Divine protection.But as humble, and dark of skin as he was, within his bosom pulsed as true a heart as ever received the Divine commission,    Go ye into all the word, and preach the gospel to every creature.    It was heard and answered.
 >> Calmness filled his soul   trust in God cheered him on his way; and giving loose reins to his horse, he proceeded on his uncertain journey, intending to let his horse take his own way.   

 >> After passing several houses, his horse turned up to a dwelling and stopped.

 >> He alighted and entered, requesting the privilege of warming.
While sitting by the fire, a child some five or six years of age, began to weep most sorrowfully; the mother took her into another room, that she might quiet her; but soon returned, surprised and astonished, exclaiming,    Who are you?where are you going? and are you hungry?    He told her his name, and that he was hungry.She soon prepared supper for him, and her husband coming in, he was requested to spend the night with them.There being a meeting in the place, he attended with the family; the appointment was for a Methodist circuit preacher; but it grew late, and no one arrived, some one requested him to preach, although he was not aware that any one knew that he was a preacher.His mind seemed led into the condition of the people, and he commenced the services; but before he had finished the preliminary exercises, the circuit minister came; but insisted on the previous arrangement.His soul launched out freely into the deep waters of salvation for lost men; and the mighty power of the gospel was felt upon many hearts, which resulted in the conversion of several that evening, and was the commencement of a glorious revival in that place.His success in this place had a powerful influence upon him, in dispelling his doubts, confirming his faith, and preparing him to engage in his great mission work with new confidence.

I early began to address my companions on the subject of education, and the advantages of intelligence over ignorance, and, as far as I dared, I tried to show the agency of ignorance in keeping men in slavery.Webster's spelling book and the Columbian Orator were looked into again.As summer came on, and the long Sabbath days stretched themselves over our idleness, I became uneasy, and wanted a Sabbath school, in which to exercise my gifts, and to impart the little knowledge of letters which I possessed, to my brother slaves.A house was hardly necessary in the summer time; I could hold my school under the shade of an old oak tree, as well as any where else.The thing was, to get the scholars, and to have them thoroughly imbued with the desire to learn.Two such boys were quickly secured, in Henry and John, and from them the contagion spread.I was not long in bringing around me twenty or thirty young men, who enrolled themselves, gladly, in my Sabbath school, and were willing to meet me regularly, under the trees or elsewhere, for the purpose of learning to read.It was surprising with what ease they provided themselves with spelling books.These were mostly the cast off books of their young masters or mistresses.I taught, at first, on our own farm.
 >> All were impressed with the necessity of keeping the matter as private as possible, for the fate of the St. Michael's attempt was notorious, and fresh in the minds of all.

 >> Our pious masters, at St. Michael's, must not know that a few of their dusky brothers were learning to read the word of God, lest they should come down upon us with the lash and chain.

 >> We might have met to drink whisky, to wrestle, fight. and to do other unseemly things, with no fear of interruption from the saints or the sinners of St. Michael's.
But, to meet for the purpose of improving the mind and heart, by learning to read the sacred scriptures, was esteemed a most dangerous nuisance, to be instantly stopped.The slaveholders of St. Michael's, like slaveholders elsewhere, would always prefer to see the slaves engaged in degrading sports, rather than to see them acting like moral and accountable beings.
Had any one asked a religious white man, in St. Michael's, twenty years ago, the names of three men in that town, whose lives were most after the pattern of our Lord and Master, Jesus Christ, the first three would have been as follows:
And yet, these were the men who ferociously rushed in upon my Sabbath school, at St. Michael's, armed with mob-like missiles, and forbade our meeting again, on pain of having our backs made bloody by the lash.This same Garrison West was my class leader, and I must say, I thought him a christian, until he took part in breaking up my school.He led me no more after that.The plea for this outrage was then, as it is now and at all times,   the danger to good order.If the slaves learnt to read, they would learn something else, and something worse.The peace of slavery would be disturbed; slave rule would be endangered.

The last answer seemed to amuse them, and finding they could elicit nothing from me I was released.I knew that I was in a critical condition, for if it could be proven that any man assisted in the least one who was making his escape, the punishment would be very severe.
   About these times the laws of Missouri were such that no man could transact business in any part of the state or city, unless he were a citizen or had a permit from proper authorities.Bishop Payne had occasion to visit the church in St. Louis, but had failed to obtain the proper authority from the city officers.The enemies of African Methodism, who were always on the alert, had him arrested and brought before a magistrate.We employed an attorney for him, a Mr. Shreeves, who was a shrewd lawyer.He was indicted, but the name was given    Tom Payne,    instead of Daniel A. Payne, from which fact his lawyer contended that he was not the man, and he was released.The lawyer told me to take him immediately, for he was my man.I hurried him out of court and put him into my carriage.I had a swift horse, and if ever a horse was made to travel, my horse did that day.

 >> African Methodism being fully established in St. Louis, it extended its influence through the surrounding communities.
The church established at New Orleans had won the attention of many parts of the South, and the work was fast spreading.About the year 1851, I began to think of the itinerant work.I thought seriously and prayerfully over the matter and asked for God's direction, that he might assist me in making my decision.I finally concluded to extend the missionary work through St. Louis county, and for some distance around in adjoining counties.I visited Carondelet, about eight miles from the city.I gathered the people together and made known to them my intentions.I set forth the doctrines of the A. M. E. Church and urged the utility of forming a society of that persuasion.They accepted the offer and we formed a mission with twenty-five members.

I must now write to you about the ladies here.They are great coquettes, go with their heads well dressed, which they arrange themselves with great taste.Your business (hair-dressing) would be worth nothing here.You must not come to this place to make your fortune; it would be a bad speculation.   
We feel as if we had hardly done justice to the constant and elevated view which Toussaint took of his responsibility towards his own race.He never forgot that his color separated him from white men, and always spoke of himself as a negro.He sometimes related little anecdotes arising from this circumstance which amused him.One occurs to me that made him laugh heartily.A little girl, the child of a lady whom he often visited, came and stood before him, looking him steadily in the face, and said,    Toussaint, do you live in a black house?   
When he was very sick, a friend who was with him asked him if she should close a window, the light of which shone full in his face.    
 >> O non, Madame,    he replied,    car alors je serai trop noir   ;      O no, Madam, for then I shall be too black.    

 >> This humorous notice of his color, without the slightest want of self-respect, was entirely in keeping with his character.

 >> He was a true negro, such as God had made him, and he never strove to be any thing else.
The black men represented as heroes in works of fiction often lose their identity, and cease to interest us as representatives of their race, for they are white men in all but color.It was a striking trait in Toussaint, that he wished to ennoble his brethren, by making them feel their moral responsibility as colored men, not as aping the customs, habits, and conversation of white men.He never forgot that he    lived in a black house,    nor wished others to forget it.
For many years Toussaint's life seems to have passed unmarked by any sorrows which do not occur to every one.He had accumulated what to his moderate views was an independence, and enabled him to assist others.Juliette's mother lived with them, and was supported by him till she died.He had no connections of his own, but his kindness to all who needed it was unceasing.We think there are many who will recollect this period, and the cheerful little parlor where they convened their guests.

The week passed away, and Saturday night came, and I was anxious to return again.I called my men together once more, and asked them how they were getting along, and they said all things were well.I asked them then, if they ever thought any thing about getting free.

## CONTEXT: 

Amen.
To this demand the proud fiend agreed, hence the writer here became somewhat relieved of said inexpressible excruciating feelings, as before named, until he came to Pittsfield, Mass., say on or about the hour of ten o'clock, P.M., where he concluded to get out and put up for the night, and so prepare to meet his fate, yea, if it was to leave this for another world, only to go bedecked with the scars of honor before the Throne of inspection of his Royal Prince, and there be conducted to a seat, accordingly, in the presence of all the olden time heroes of the cross of Christ that we read of, too tedious here to mention.
So we pass to notice next the dreadful and most miraculous event that occurred between the writer and satan.But here, before we enter the battle field, say, may the humble penman here entreat with his loving readers only to suffer him to speak, and after he has spoken, if ye will mock, then mock on, only that ye mock not to your own hurt or folly.Hence, he having arrived at said town, and the cars having stopped, he here, in leaping from the cars, was smitten to the ground, by an invisible stroke, into the snow, about knee deep, and here, upon rising to his feet, he was smitten down the second time, and when upon rising again, he was nearly crushed up against the stone wall, so by this the writer was brought to tremble, yea, and to stagger around like unto a drunken man.But here after a while he found his way to the house of a colored family, where he was most kindly received and entertained for the night, but their names he does not here recollect, he having introduced himself to them in particular, when having named to them that he was on his way to Boston, to see said Governor, on some particular business, which of course went to entitle him to their confidence as a stranger.But dear souls, little did they think of the dreadful conflict that was to befall their poor visitor, even that night; nay, nay.Hence, they having blessed their stranger to a good warm supper, he had prayer with them, and having sung a hymn, they kindly conducted him to his retirement, that might be truly called a garden of Gethsemane to him, as follows: Say, it being now about half past eleven o'clock, leaving but a few more moments to decide the poor penman's fate, therefore to prayer; Israel pray whilst your young David shall assault Goliath, the winged fiend of darkness, he having nothing to fight with but Christ the Lord, yea, the little white stone upon which are all the names of saints written since the day that Adam fell.Hence, pray ye children, pray, believing that God, your heavenly Father, has never left himself without living witnesses of his power and saving grace.Even so, amen, and halleluajh, praise his holy name.

 >> And now, he having fell on his knees by the bed side, as truly for the last time in this low world, before his God he prayed thus:    O thou God of all goodness, love and power, grant to this thy servant even grace this night to answer grace, that he may in the name of his Lord, and of his consecrated cross, conquer both earth and hell by a celestial power, and for said victory will he, on his part, meet the demands of satan to the letter and to the spirit thereof, in even giving up his two dear children (himself being understood), namely Julia and Joseph, as a living sacrifice upon thy altar, O God, and for which let it be recorded in heaven and known to the ends of the earth.

 >> Even so, amen and amen, and selah.    

 >> And here, he having met the demands of satan fully in heart, soul, mind and spirit, it was in this did the writer drink of the cup of his Lord and master, in which was truly mingled all of the very dregs of satan's last vial of wrath: yea, so much so, that by the time he had barely rose from the floor, and laid himself upon the bed, when in midst of his inexpressible anguish of soul and mind, as is truly explained in his major Journal, there occurred a sudden crash or explosion in his head, yea, and so dreadful and terrific was the shock that he truly thought that his skull was split wide open, and that his very brain was all out upon the neat snow white pillow case, which was all the writer here regretted, knowing that he had virtually sealed his life to the support of the cross of Christ.
But in raising himself up in the bed to feel for his brains, as he thought, in feeling out on the pillows he felt none, and here upon feeling his skull he found it to be all right; and now, being entirely free from all fear, pain or anguish, of soul, body, yea, and of mind and spirit, he was made to inquire from his inmost soul, and what did this inexpressible sense of inward joy and gladness mean?The reply from heaven was, that in his sacrifice upon the altar of his God, in the support of his holy word, as in the case of Job, it had robbed all hell of its expectation, yea, and had disthroned satan of his cruel power, and hence, the great and glorious victory may be chanted by all God's saints, as follows, as set forth in the Midnight Cry:

Victory o'er the World, the Flesh, and the Devil.
By Faith we conquer earth and hell,
By a celestial power,
Hence this the grace that shall prevail
In a decisive or dying hour.

Hence, how dare any man to profane the sacred desk in preaching Christ to be the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, when he himself will not trust in Him south of Mason & Dixon's line, as he should, as in the case of Daniel in the lion's den, and Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, when in the fiery furnace, in the city of Babylon; or otherwise, is not his services thus rendered in the house of God any thing less than a sacrilegious performance, an offering unto devils upon their shrine or hecatombs, being works without faith, which are dead, yea, truly so.Hence should not all such be called in question, for why should our land be cursed any further, as in the case of Jezebel and her 400 lying prophets.


It was just about the midnight hour,
When Jesus displayed his heavenly power,
And with his chariot drove along,
While Angels chanted the morning song.


His lightening played and thunders roll,
It shook the earth from pole to pole.
At this the devils took affright,
And left before the morning light.

Put your trust in God, and bear your sad lot with the manly fortitude which becomes a man.I shall see you at Richmond, but don't recognize me.    Saying this, Mr. Listwell handed Madison ten dollars; said a few words to the other slaves; received their hearty    God bless you,    and made his way to the house.
Fearful of exciting suspicion by too long delay, our friend went to the breakfast table, with the air of one who half reproved the greediness of those who rushed in at the sound of the bell.A cup of coffee was all that he could manage.His feelings were too bitter and excited, and his heart was too full with the fate of poor Madison (whom he loved as well as admired) to relish his breakfast; and although he sat long after the company had left the table, he really did little more than change the position of his knife and fork.The strangeness of meeting again one whom he had met on two several occasions before, under extraordinary circumstances, was well calculated to suggest the idea that a supernatural power, a wakeful providence, or an inexorable fate, had linked their destiny together; and that no efforts of his could disentangle him from the mysterious web of circumstances which enfolded him.
On leaving the table, Mr. Listwell nerved himself up and walked firmly into the bar-room.He was at once greeted again by that talkative chatter-box, Mr. Wilkes.
   Them's a likely set of niggers in the alley there,    said Wilkes.
   
 >> Yes, they're fine looking fellows, one of them I should like to purchase, and for him I would be willing to give a handsome sum.   

 >> Turning to one of his comrades, and with a grin of victory, Wilkes said,    Aha, Bill, did you hear that?

 >> I told you I know'd that gentleman wanted to buy niggers, and would bid as high as any purchaser in the market.      
Come, come,    said Listwell,    don't be too loud in your praise, you are old enough to know that prices rise when purchasers are plenty.   
   That's a fact,    said Wilkes,    I see you knows the ropes   and there's not a man in old Virginy whom I'd rather help to make a good bargain than you, sir.   
   Mr. Listwell here threw a dollar at Wilkes, (which the latter caught with a dexterous hand,) saying,    Take that for your kind good will.    Wilkes held up the dollar to his right eye, with a grin of victory, and turned to the morose grumbler in the corner who had questioned the liberality of a man of whom he knew nothing.
Mr. Listwell now stood as well with the company as any other occupant of the bar-room.
We pass over the hurry and bustle, the brutal vociferations of the slave-drivers in getting their unhappy gang in motion for Richmond; and we need not narrate every application of the lash to those who faltered in the journey.Mr. Listwell followed the train at a long distance, with a sad heart; and on reaching Richmond, left his horse at a hotel, and made his way to the wharf in the direction of which he saw the slave-coffle driven.He was just in time to see the whole company embark for New Orleans.

General Toussaint sent me back his sons with a letter in which he assured me that he desired nothing so much as the happiness of the colony, and that he was ready to obey all the orders that I should give him.
   I ordered him to come to me; I gave him an assurance that I would employ him as my lieutenant-general: he replied to that order by mere words; he only seeks to gain time.
   I have been commanded by the French Government to establish here prosperity and abundance promptly; if I allow myself to be amused by cunning and perfidious ciruumlocutions, the colony will be the theatre of a long civil war.
   I commence my campaign, and I will teach that rebel what is the force of the French Government.
   From this moment, he must be regarded by all good Frenchmen residing in Saint Domingo only as an insensate monster.
   I have promised liberty to the inhabitants of Saint Domingo; I will see that they enjoy it.I will cause persons and property to be respected.
   I ordain what follows:   
   Article 1.   General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; every good citizen is commanded to seize them, and to treat them as rebels to the French Republic.
   Article 2.   
 >> From the day when the French army shall have taken up quarters, every officer, whether civil or military, who shall obey other orders than those of the Generals of the army of the French Republic, which I command, shall be treated as a rebel.

 >> The agricultural laborers who have been led into error, and who, deceived by the perfidious insinuations of the rebel Generals, may have taken up arms, shall be treated as wandering children, and shall be sent back to tillage, provided they have not endeavored to incite insurrection.   
Article 4.   The soldiers of the demi-brigades who shall abandon the army of Toussaint, shall form part of the French army.
   Article 5.   General Augustin Clervaux, who commands the Department of the Ciboa, having acknowledged the French government, and the authority of the Captain-general, is maintained in his rank and in his command.

General Paine arrived about the commencement of the trial, and presented a firm front to the tyrants.My lawyer asked by what law they claimed me.They said, under the black law of Ohio.The reply was, that I was not a black man.Postlewaite said he arrested me, as the property of Archibald Logan, under the article of the constitution, that persons    owing service,    and fleeing from one state to another, shall be given up to the person to whom such service is due.He then read the power of attorney, from Deacon Logan to him, authorizing him to seize one Milton Clarke   describing me as a person five feet two and a half inches tall, probably trying to pass myself off as white.    His hair is straight, but curls a little at the lower end.    After reading this, he read his other papers, showing that I was the slave of Logan.He produced a bill of sale, from Joseph to Deacon Logan.He then asked me if I had not lived, for several years, with Deacon Logan.

He then said to me,    D   n you; we will pay you for all this, when we get home.    The anxiety on my part, by this time, was beyond any thing I ever felt in my life.I sometimes hoped the people would rescue me, and then feared they would not.Many of them showed sympathy in their countenances, and I could see that the savageism of Postlewaite greatly increased it.My lawyer then asked, for what I owed service to Deacon Logan; told Harper & Co., if Mr. Clarke owed the deacon, present his bill, and, if it is a reasonable one, his friends will pay it.He then asked me if I owed Deacon Logan, of Kentucky.I told him no   the deacon owed me about eight hundred dollars; I owed him nothing.Postlewaite said, then, he arrested me as the goods and chattels of Logan.

## CONTEXT: 

Oh, memorable night!Never before was joy so violently contrasted with sorrow.
At 11 o'clock at night I was awakened by an old friend and neighbor, Miss M. Brown, with the startling intelligence that the entire Cabinet had been assassinated, and Mr. Lincoln shot, but not mortally wounded.When I heard the words I felt as if the blood had been frozen in my veins, and that my lungs must collapse for the want of air.Mr. Lincoln shot!the Cabinet assassinated!What could it mean?The streets were alive with wondering, awe-stricken people.Rumors flew thick and fast, and the wildest reports came with every new arrival.The words were repeated with blanched cheeks and quivering lips.
 >> I waked Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, and told them that the President was shot, and that I must go to the White House.

 >> I could not remain in a state of uncertainty.

 >> I felt that the house would not hold me.
They tried to quiet me, but gentle words could not calm the wild tempest.They quickly dressed themselves, and we sallied out into the street to drift with the excited throng.We walked rapidly towards the White House, and on our way passed the residence of Secretary Seward, which was surrounded by armed soldiers, keeping back all intruders with the point of the bayonet.We hurried on, and as we approached the White House, saw that it too was surrounded with soldiers Every entrance was strongly guarded, and no one was permitted to pass.The guard at the gate told us that Mr. Lincoln had not been brought home, but refused to give any other information.More excited than ever, we wandered down the street.Grief and anxiety were making me weak, and as we joined the outskirts of a large crowd, I began to feel as meek and humble as a penitent child.A gray-haired old man was passing.

## CONTEXT: 

The bars were placed across the door on the occasion of Sims' arrest.Immediately after the extradition of Burns, the United States received a notice to quit the premises in thirty days, which was done, and the federal courts were removed to a private dwelling temporarily fitted up.The iron bars with their fastenings were removed, and the room was afterwards partially destroyed, (perhaps purified also,) by a fire that seriously threatened the destruction of the whole building.Had the assailants succeeded in clearing their way through all other opposition., this formidable barrier alone was sufficient to have held them in check until the arrival of a military force.
In another part of the building, the judges of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts were assembled at the same hour, awaiting the return of a jury.Some of the latter having incautiously put their heads out of the window to ascertain the nature of the tumult, were fired at indiscriminately, to the serious danger of their lives.
In the City Hall, hard by, the Mayor, with several officers of the municipal government, happened to be present at the same hour. Notified by the Chief of Police of the state of affairs, he at once ordered out two companies of artillery.Both arrived on the ground before midnight, and were stationed, the one in the Court House, the other in the City Hall.At the same time, the Marshal dispatched his deputy to procure a body of United States troops.
 >> Proceeding to East Boston, the deputy there chartered a steamer, directed his course with all speed to Fort Warren, and took on board a corps of marines under command of Maj. S. C. Ridgley.

 >> In six hours after, they were quartered within the walls of the Court House.

 >> Another company of marines was dispatched from the Navy Yard in Charlestown, on the requisition of the Marshal, and was also quartered in the same building.CHAPTER III.
THE WRIT OF PERSONAL REPLEVIN.
THE attempt to release Burns from duress by violence having failed, steps were taken to accomplish the same object by legal process.For this purpose resort was had to the Writ of Personal Replevin.This writ is one of those great safeguards which every free state is careful to provide for protecting the liberty of its citizens.Less famous than the Writ of Habeas Corpus, it is in some respects more valuable than that, more efficacious in securing the end for which both were instituted, and not less worthy to be maintained in full operative vigor.To obtain the writ of habeas corpus, special application must be made to a judge on the bench or in chambers, and it rests with him to grant or refuse it at his option; often it is refused.The writ of replevin, on the other hand, issues of course and of right; the prisoner, or any personal friend, or any stranger acting in his behalf, may cause it to be made at pleasure.As in the case of ordinary writs, blank forms bearing the name of the Chief Justice abound; one of these is filled up by an attorney or some competent person, and placed in the hands of an officer, upon whom, from that moment, it becomes imperative.

## CONTEXT: 

With this individual he had made an appointment to spend one more night in sin; but death interfered and disappointed them both.Stewart's convictions of mind were thereupon greatly increased, and he began to despair of ever obtaining mercy at the hand of the Lord.One day while wandering along the banks of the Ohio, bewailing his wretched and undone condition, the arch enemy of souls suggested to him a remedy; which was to terminate the miseries he endured, by leaping into the deep, and thereby putting an end to his existence.To this suggestion, he at first felt a disposition to yield; but his attention was arrested by a voice, which as he thought, called him by name, when on looking around he could see no person, whereupon he desisted from the further prosecution of the desperate project.He then resolved to make another effort to seek mercy and pardon at the hand of God.Having hired a house for the purpose of carrying on his trade, (the blue dying business,) he had another opportunity of being much alone, which privilege he improved in seeking the Lord   carefully with tears.    The more he exercised himself in meditation and prayer, the more was he impressed with a sense of his guilt.He now saw no way for him to escape the wrath to come   he felt that he deserved to be driven from the presence of the Most High into   outer darkness.    It was then that he was enabled to cast himself at the foot of the cross, and to lay hold by faith on the Saviour of sinners as his last and only refuge, crying   Lord save or I perish!   Then it was that the Lord was pleased to reveal his mercy and pardonning love to his fainting soul, causing him to burst forth from his closet in raptures of unspeakable joy, declaring what the Lord had done for his poor soul.
 >> He now could truly say,    Jesus all the day long,Is my joy and my song.    

 >> He could then rejoice in the Lord from a sense of the   love of God being shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost,   &c. There being no Baptist church near, he did not join himself to any religious Society.   

 >> In his youth he had imbibed strong prejudices against other denominations, particularly the Methodists, of whom he had a contemptible opinion.
Thus, slighting and neglecting the duties of the temple, it will not be surprising to hear that he soon neglected those of the closet also, which soon resulted in a dead and barren state of soul.He now began to feel the pains and miseries from which the Lord had so recently delivered him.Whereupon he began to doubt the reality or genuineness of his conversion, and this appears to have resulted from his belief of a doctrine in which he had been educated, namely   once in grace always in grace.    In this situation he remained for some time, bewailing his wretched case, when, as he walked out one evening he heard the sound of singing and praying proceed from a house at no great distance.It proved to be a Methodist prayer meeting.His prejudice first forbade his going in; but curiosity prompted him to venture a little nearer, and at length he resolved to enter and make known his case, which he did to the few who were in attendance.Here he was encouraged to seek with all his heart the last blessing.Soon after this he attended a Camp-Meeting, where he remained for sometime with a heavy heart, and disconsolate mind.

About day-break I got a little quiet; and at seven o'clock a servant came in and made the fire, and it came to me about the beet root.I said,    Well, I am better now, and I needn't mind about it.   
I got up at eight, and it came again,    Beet root tea.    But still I did not heed.About nine o'clock the same whisper came to me again:
   You said if the Lord would keep it in your mind till morning, you would make the beet root tea.   
   So I did.   
And I called Bob and sent him downstairs to ask the lady if she had any red beets.She sent me two small ones, but very nice and red; I had a small sauce pan, and I put them in and boiled them and made a strong cupful and drank it, and it did allay the irritation so that I coughed but little after that to what I had done before; and I shall ever believe that God was teaching me not to ignore the use of all means in sickness.
I believe that God is honored as much when He tells me to do a thing and I obey, as when He says not to do it, and I obey.    Thou shalt not covet.       
 >> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.    

 >> To me obedience in both cases is absolutely necessary to honor God.

 >> I only receive blessings as I obey.
Rev. D. F. Sanford, of Boston, was so kind to Bob and me, and he and his wife were at the Berachia home, at Southport, and during the series of meetings he was holding he gave Bible readings on this subject; and it seemed so clear, and many seemed to get help and blessing, and I did too.
But many thought I was not half out of the woods.So one day two ladies called to see me, after I had returned to Liverpool.I had never seen them before, but they said they had heard of me; and one of them, Mrs. A., told me of her wonderful experience of how she was healed of dropsy.
I was deeply interested, as she went on narrating all the incidents in relation to it, and how she used oil and anointed herself, as she said she felt the Lord led her to do.
   Oh,    I said,    I was out last evening to the shop, and it came to me to get some sweet oil.   
   That is it,    she said at once.
   But,    I said,    I did not get it.
